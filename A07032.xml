            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>The which Anabaptiſtes went about vnder the colour of religion and of the Goſpell, vtterly to depriue the Magiſtrate of all authoritie, and had deuiſed to make all things in common, ſaying that they were ſtirred vp by the ſpirite of GOD to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the worlde, and to ordayne and ſet vp another kinde of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill gouernement.</p>
            <p>Whereupon, the enemie of the true doctrine which was preached in the beginning, had then that which hee looked for: Inſomuche that the moſt mightie and inuincible Monarche of famous memorie the Emperour Charles the fifth, was aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that all ſuch as ſpake agaynſt the faultes and abuſes of the Church of Rome, and refuted them, were infected with that he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, and had determined to take away from Princes and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates their authoritie and power, to aboliſhe all pollitike go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, to confounde all ciuill ordinaunces, and would ſet vp and put in practiſe an horrible chaunge in all thinges: by whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che information, his Imperiall Maieſtie was eaſily perſwaded to ordayne and ſet downe very ſeuere ordinances &amp; edictes tou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And to proue this to be true, his Maiſties edict publiſhed at Wormes, is a ſufficient teſtimonie: by which was declared, that his Maieſtie was throughly informed, that their doctrine tended to the ſame effect, &amp; therefore, his will &amp; pleaſure was, that the ſame edict ſhoulde w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> out diſſimulation, or tolleration, &amp; w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> out re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of any perſon or perſons, of what eſtate or conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſoeuer, be put in execution. Inſomuch, that all officers followed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame preſently, ſome for the hatred that they had to the ſame doctrine, otherſome againe, for the ſpoyle which they looked for, ſought to charge innocent men with the doctrine of Luther: being readier to obey the Emperours commaundement, then Gods, who ſaith vnto tyrants, when his people ſuffer perſecution, <hi>why perſecute you mee?</hi> And although the Anabaptiſtes doctrine was nothing like vnto the doctrine of Luther and Zwinglius, which tendeth to no kinde of ſedition at all, yet for all that, the officers went ſo neere the conſciences of men, as that they ſpared not to torment pore miſerable ſoules with all kinde of crueltie, to the ende his

            <p>
               <hi>The Duke ſhall not chaunge the auncient ſtatutes and priuiledges but by the Councell and aduiſe of all the eſtates in generall, and thoſe, to be aſſembled duly and in good order: neither may they be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded and aſſembled by the Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

            <p>Firſt. The Duke ſhall not aſſemble the Clergie, without the knowledge or conſent of the other two eſtates, to wit, of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie and citizens.</p>
            <p>The ſeconde. The Duke ſhall not purſue any of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes or enhabitantes, but by the ordinarte way of iuſtice or law, to the ende the accuſed may defend him ſelfe by his aduocates or counſellers of the law, ſo that they may thereby in all pointes be able to defende his cauſe.</p>
            <p>The thirde. The Duke ſhall not impoſe any taxes or tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages vpon his ſubiectes, without the conſent of the eſtates of the countrey.</p>
            <p>The Fourth. No ſtraunger may take vpon him the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of any honourable office in Brahand, but ſuch offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as are of ſmall eſtimation or importance.</p>
            <p>The fifth. When the Duke ſommoneth and ſendeth for the generall eſtates, to obtaine any thing at their hands, the Braban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb facs="tcp:11838:10"/>are not bounde to remoue, or conclude of any thing out of their countrey.</p>
            <p>The ſixt, if the Duke will forcibly or otherwiſe infringe or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face their priuiledges, the Brabanders, after duetiful and gentie proteſtation, are diſcharged of their othe made to the Duke, &amp; at their free choyſe to doe whatſoeuer they thinke good.</p>
            <p>Ouer and beſides the aforeſaid ſupplication of the Braba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders,
<note place="margin">A ſupplication exhibited by thoſe of Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</note> they of Flanders, exhibited another ſupplication: &amp; although an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere was made them, that the Kings meaning neither had byn, nor yet now was, to bring in the Inquiſition (which made y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple greatly ſuſpect, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the kings commandements &amp; edictes were counterfeited in the low countries without his Ma. knowledgee) yet for al this, there was great &amp; maruellous preparation made in al places. For, in al Senates, courts &amp; Parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, ſome were appoynted, to looke, whether his ſubiects went to maſſe or no, &amp; whether they folowed the ordinances of the romiſh church: which officers were bound to make true certificate therof once euery 3. moneths at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> court of Bruxelles: yea &amp; the Inquiſitors the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues had ful authority to execute ſuch their imagination and deuiſe as was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formable &amp; agreeing w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> that inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that was granted the <hi>31.</hi> of May in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yeere <hi>1550.</hi> By which they had ful co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion &amp; authority to adminiſter the Inquiſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to condemne, correct, &amp; chaſtiſe, or to impriſon, and appoynt into the handes of the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate and officer whom they would. Moreouer, that they might haue &amp; vſe what filthy priſons ſoeuer they pleaſed, to iudge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ordinary maner of lawe,
<note place="margin">A ſecret &amp; moſte ſubtill perſuaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Spaniſhe Inquiſition.</note> &amp; ſometimes choſe anye one of his Ma. counſel to giue iudgement as pleaſed them, &amp; according to the forme &amp; tenure of the popiſh Bul. This ſentence was giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt al ſuch as were ſuſperted to be of the religion, or as they themſelues ſaid, of Luthers or Zwinglius hereſie: and as many as read any of the books forbidden by the Pope, ſhould be burnt with thoſe bookes: and as many alſo as frequented any conuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, where any diſputing or reaſoning of the holy ſcriptures was. Ouer &amp; beſides this, al his maieſties ſubiects of what eſtate or condition ſoeuer they were, whether Preſident, Counſeller, Boroughmaiſter, or whatſoeuer officer els, were enforced before the Inquiſitors, to take knowledge of as many as were preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted vnto them, &amp; puniſh al thoſe that were fauourers of herefie and heretikes.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the Inquiſitors tooke a note of all merchants &amp;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:11838:10"/>artificers, poore, or rich, that were any way ſuſpected of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med religion. The Inquiſitors are commonly Franciſcanes, or preaching Friers, which take a note of al ſuche as come not to confeſſion, or that offer not to their boxe: giuing a copie of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the new biſhops: whoſe officers, as vſhers, &amp; Sariauntes, firſt of al, by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poſition burdened the poore ſoules, who ſoone after were enforced to flee the countrey if they would not be taken, &amp; ſo put to death: as by experience, often was ſeene.</p>
            <p>At that time it was noyſed all the low countrey throughout,
<note place="margin">A brute &amp; ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor of warres in the low coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</note> &amp; ſuppoſed to be a moſt certaine truth, that Duke Erike of Bru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wike had leuyed a mighty army both of horſemen &amp; footmen, to plant the Inquiſition in the low countries by force of armes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly as he had before, by the deuiſe &amp; purpoſe of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of Granuelle, enterpriſed to accompliſhe, &amp; ſo by that meane mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to make a conqueſt of the prouinces of the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of Belgique, and aboliſh al priuiledges and franchiſes, and in the end make an abſolute kingdome of it: &amp; for this cauſe, was the charge com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the rulers and captaines, who had receiued money of Duke Erike for the leuying of men of warre.</p>
            <p>Theſe newnes engendered ſuch a great feare in the hearts of the people, as that the notableſt &amp; richeſt mercha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> countrey,

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, there were certaine gouernours &amp; officers of great autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity &amp; wealth, who firſt conſidering of the horrible effect &amp; tenure of the letters, manifeſtly declaring, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in caſe there were any man that would oppoſe himſelf againſt the meaning of thoſe letters, &amp; not ayde the Inquiſitors for the accompliſhing of their commſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he, whatſoeuer he was ſhould be depoſed from his eſtate, &amp; another placed in his roome, &amp; next of al, they ſeeyng the fury and wrath of the people to be greatly moued through ſuch diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly charges and tyrannies, and become ſo outragious &amp; mad, that they would not ſpare any magiſtrate or officer whatſoeuer.
<pb facs="tcp:11838:11"/>And laſt of all conſidering that they coulde not with a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in ſuch a caſe, be both plantifes &amp; Iudges, they were fully reſolued to yeelde vp their offices into the kings hands, if he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to perſiſt in that his intended opinion.</p>

Neither did they forget to ſhewe the great dammage and loſſe whiche the countrey was like to receiue, through the want of the recourſe and company of the Marchantes: ſeeing that marchandize is the very nurſe of theſe Prouinces, and that by reaſon of the trade thereof in other partes, the enhabitantes of the lowe Countreys, ſhould be ready to ſtarue: And that which is more, that the bondage of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, wherunto they ſhoulde be alwayes tyed, was nowe concluded vppon. Moreouer, they compared all theſe thinges to other prouinces and regions, with their franchiſes and liberties, ſaying, that theſe prouinces, farre paſſed all other in trade of marchandiſe, and goodneſſe of Ground: and further tolde them, of the great commoditie which other prouinces re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued from theſe lowe Countreys, and coulde not be without them. Neuertheleſſe, their fidelitie and conſtant loyaltie to their prince was ſo great, and wrought ſo in them, as that they gaue no eare to ſuch ſuborners: but aduertiſed the Magiſtrate to be ware of this fetch and drift, and preueut it: howbeit, they were no whit the more abaſhed for all this, neither knewe they what was beſt for them to do, or what beſt, to be left vndone.</p>

<note place="margin">The bringing in of the new Biſhoppes.</note> and in what fort theſe new biſhops were erected, we are to know, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Prieſtes &amp; Inquiſitors, for their better aſſurance of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bringing in of the inquiſition into king Philips dominions, conſidering that certaine eccleſiaſticall prelates, in ſome meaſure fauoured the Proteſtants, and were in great authoritie and very rich, they therefore greatly enuied them for it.

            <p>Thirdly, Theſe beeing diſpatched, it ſhal behoue vs alſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue the king from vs, and ſo deale with him, as that hee neuer returne thence, and that no Fleming bee ſuffered to haue acceſſe vnto him, or yet ſpeake with him.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That the king ſhal write and ſend vnto the orders of the Clear gie men of the low countries, to accept fifteene new Biſhops with the inquiſition, who ſhall haue free power ouer all ſeculer Iuriſdiction, yea euen to deale in matters of high treaſon.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, The ſubiectes of the low countries, by reaſon of their malice and ouer full fed, will reuoult, rayſe commotions and tumultes agreeing to all thinges, ſauing vnto thoſe that wee bring in.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, The princes and nobles, with the chiefe leaders and Authours of theſe factions, as alſo the ſubiects, may heereupon by ſome ſlie and ſubtill dealing bee diſpatched of their liues, and the reſt brought into good frame and order.</p>
            <p>Seuenthly, we will at our owne perill like of the reauers &amp; robbers of all churches and images, and by ſome ſubtill ſhifte or other make all the woride impute the fault thereof vnto the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belles, and ſo by that meane wee ſhall get the vpper hande of them.</p>
            <p>Eightly, wee will ouerthrowe all trafficke, trade of merchau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, riches, wealth, liberties, and priueleges: and bring them all vnto extreeme beggerie: and ſo by this meane the Realme ſhall be euer ours.</p>
            <p>Nienthly, There ſhall none in all the low countries (except thoſe of our faction) bee thought worthie to liue, ſo that in the ende wee will roote out from amongeſt them all goods, landes, occupations, and all good order: and make a new kingdome and new people thereof.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, For accompliſhing of this office and dealing, the wiſe and valiant duke of <hi>Alba</hi> ſhall be perſonally preſent, and in regard of him, no man els ſhall bee eſteemed of, no although he
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:11838:13"/>bee of the king or princes blood: and that if any of them, be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of neuer ſo ſmall a crime, they ſhall bee by cunning depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of their liues.</p>
            <p>Eleuenthly, That no contracts, lawes, promiſes, pardons, othes, priuiledges and ſolemne grauntes, of the lowe countries, ſhalbe to the inhabitants thereof of any effect, but bee founde all as giltie of high treaſon.</p>
            <p>Twelfthly, aboue all things great heede muſt be had, that in theſe ſo waightie cauſes, &amp; matters of ſo great importance, there bee no violent dealing all at once, but faire and eaſily, and by lie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little in very good order: to the ende the princes, nobles, &amp; communaltie might fal our amongſt themſelues, and one perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute another, inſomuche that the perſecutor himſelfe might fall into the grinne. For, in all Chriſtendome, there is not a more fooliſhe and indiſcrete nation, and more eaſily to bee deceiued then the Fleming, whoſe infidelitie God by this meane will puniſh.</p>
            <p>In the yeere 1559, the Inquiſitors &amp; other their complices, with the helpe of Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the 4.
<note place="margin">The eſtates will not allowe the new biſhops</note> went about to put in practiſe the eſtabliſhing of the newe Biſhops, but they were as yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and put of by the Eſtates. Wherupon they of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> low coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie exhibited their ſupplications and complaintes vnto the king for the ſtaying of the ſame, howbeit they tooke ſmal effect: which thing when the noble men of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> low countrie ſaw, they thought this change of the Eccleſiaſticall eſtate to bee very ſtrange, and perceiued it to tend to none other end, but to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bringing in of the Spaniſh inquiſition into the lowe countrie. Whereupon, they again made their ſuplications and complaints vnto the Dutches of <hi>parma</hi> gouerneſſe of the low countrie for the king, vnto the yeere 1562. In which yeere, they were very deſirous to ſee an end of the troubles and ciuill warres in Fraunce: in the meane while continually beſeeching the ſaide Lady Regent to intreat his Maieſtie for ſome moderation, which ſhee receiued in the yeere 1563. Afterward they beſought that they might obteme the ſame libertie, that the French had obteined at the handes of their king: conſidering that the French king had neuer brought his Realm vnto that peace and quietnes, neither yet his ſubiects vnto that obedience, but by the graunting of them the libertie of
<pb facs="tcp:11838:14"/>conſcience, and exerciſe of religion, according to the edict made at <hi>Orleance:</hi> and therefore they beſought his Catholique ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, to graunt vnto them the ſame grace and fauour. After that the principall Lords had ſhewed and laid open, the ancient priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, and liberties, the oth of the king, the chedience of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects vnto his maieſtie, the concord of the countrye, and the great number of the Proteſtants, they obtained releaſe of the rigorous commiſſions, and a ſurceaſing of the Inquiſition, wherupon the troubles for the more part were appeaſed, which thing greatly diſplaſed the Cleargie men, but eſpecially the Cardinal <hi>Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelle:</hi> For they ſaw their purpoſe made voide, and the worde of God aduanced, with increaſe of a great number of people which frequented the ſermons. Which thing cauſed the Cardinall of <hi>Gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uelle</hi> haſte him into Spaine, and neuer gaue ouer vntill ſuch time as he had ſet all his affaires in good order, and brought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to paſſe euen as he would.</p>
            <p>Ouer and beſides all this,
<note place="margin">Ambaſſadours ſent to the king from the conuſel of Trent.</note> there arriued at the Court of Spaine, certaine Ambaſſadours from the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> ſeut from the Inquiſitors, who aduertiſed his maieſtie of all that was concluded vpon in the ſaide Councel, euen from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vnto the end, which was in Ianuarie 1564. Whereupon, his Catholike maieſtie was perſuaded and induced to publiſhe thoſe decrees, and cauſe them to be kept from point to point, and to this end ſent he them into the lowe countries, that they might there take effect, as alſo into all other Countries vnder his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection, with expreſſe commandement vnto the Dutches of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> that ſhe ſhould with all diligence eſtabliſh the Inquiſition, &amp; go orderly on with it, as by the copie of the letters here ſet downe manifeſtly appeareth.</p>

                        <head>An abſtract of the kings laſt letters and writings, ſent to my Ladie the Dutches, with the laſt diſpatch as touching the ſtate of religion.</head>
                        <p>FIrſt, concerning as well the old as the new commiſſions and ordinances of the ſaid ſtate of religion, his maieſtie vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in what ſtate and condition the matters of religion heere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſtood, it was not meete that any change ſhould bee made of the ſaid commiſſions and ordinances: but that the ſaid commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the late imperial maieſtie, and alſo his maieſties, ſhould be put in execution. And ſo his maieſtie might perceiue that the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion why this miſchiefe encreaſed and went ſo far, was by the negligence, looſenes, and hypocriſie of the Iudges. And that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there were ſome Iudges who either durſt not, or els woulde not put them in execution, for feare of tumult or vprore, that his maieſtie might be counſelled to prouide for men there, that were of greater courage, and more zealous to take in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the ſaid exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, whereof could be no want in thoſe countries, where were ſo many catholiques that deſired to ſerue God and his maieſtie, and that in ſo doing, &amp; executing of the ſaid commiſſions, it was to bee hoped that the harme which grew thereby, might by that meanes be the ſoner and better remedied, then any way els. For the ſecond: which concerned the Inquiſitors of the faith, his maieſty charged her highnes to hold ſuch an hand on the matter, as that the Inquiſitors myght find fauour as touchyng the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe &amp; adminiſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their charge, in whatſoeuer was meete for the benefit and maintenance of the religion, his maieſtie ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing this meaning y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Inquiſitors ſhould deale with the ſayde inquiſition, as it was wonted to bee dealt with all euen vnto that preſent, both by the lawes of God &amp; men, &amp; that this was no new or ſtrange matter, ſeeing it had bin alwaies ſo vſed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the time of the late imperial Maieſtie, and his, the inconueniences which they ouer much feared being mamfeſter, neerer at hand, and far greater, in not foreſeeing vnto thoſe things which were behoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the office of the Inquiſitors, and for theyr aſſiſtance. And ſith her highnes might wel ſee that, which this matter imported, his maieſtie gaue her in charge, that ſhee ſhoulde as much as in
<pb facs="tcp:11838:16"/>her lay, do that that was ſo neceſſary, &amp; neuer yeeld to haue any other thing then it, to be dealt in, ſeeing her highnes knew how neere it touched his heart, and what pleaſure and contentation it would bring him.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, his maieſtie willed her highnes, that ſeeing the holy counſell of <hi>Trent</hi> was now publiſhed, and that ther remained no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els to be done but the ſetting vp of the new erected biſhops, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> her highnes would put to all the poſſible help ſhe could, for the effectuall and conuenient proceeding thereof. And that ſhe ſhold alſo ſee, the ordena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the councell of <hi>Trent</hi> executed about the reformation of the liues &amp; maners of the cleargie, by which both his maieſty, her hignes, and all other his maieſties officers were charged to ſhew al their fauour, &amp; help, as far as was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> behalf. &amp; if ſo be it ſhould ſo fall out, as that his maieſtie ſhould be driuen to make prouiſion for the ſame, that it ſhoulde foorthwith diſpatch euen amongeſt thoſe cleargie men whiche woulde not ſubmit themſelues to the reformation ſet downe by the biſhops, agreeing with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> decree of the ſaid councel of <hi>Trent.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And in the end, this was the cloſing vp of altogether, that the thing which his maieſty wrote to her highnes of, as aforeſaid, was moſt conuenient for the benefite of the religion, and the countries thereabout, which without it, were of no valure, becauſe that the religion was it that muſt bee the locke and key to cenſerue them in their right, &amp; keepe them in peace, reſt, and quietnes. And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that her highnes ſaw the great importance thereof, his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty againe required her to take that courſe, becauſe, as hee ſaid, it would be the thing that he beſt liked of, and would cauſe him to thinke the better both of her highnes, and alſo of the Lordes that were about her, whom of very right ſhe ought to charge, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow their paine and trauell about the ſame, according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truſt which his maieſty repoſed in them, wherin they right wel knew that they ſhoulde not onely greatly content &amp; pleaſe him, but alſo doe ſuch offices &amp; duties therm, as became ſuch noble eſtates as they are, and ſo acquite &amp; diſcharge that bonde wherein they ſtand bound for the ſeruice of God, his maieſtie, the common weale of the lowe countries thereabout, and theyr owne parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer benefite.</p>
                        <p>Many of the nobilitie beeing greatly abaſhed and amazed at

                           <pb n="10" facs="tcp:11838:16"/>this his maieſties charge and commandement, and foreſeeing a moſt aſſured and vtter deſolation neceſſarily following the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of this his excellencies, and her highnes, determinations: ſo wiſely dealt with the Dutches of <hi>parma</hi> in that matter, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in the end ſhee ſent the Counte <hi>Egmont</hi> towardes the kyng of Spaine, giuing him charge &amp; commiſſion, to ſeek by al meanes poſſible the mittigation of his maieſties heart, in getting him to ceaſe the inquiſition in the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries thereabout. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te was returned out of Spain, he brought letters thence with him to the Dutches, charging her to deuiſe ſome ſound &amp; fit meanes for the quiet &amp; tranquility of the country, alwayes prouided that the catholike religion ſhould in no wiſe be empayred. For per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formyng wherof, ſhe appointed 3. biſhops, &amp; three doctors, who were wel ſeene both in dininitie, and alſo in the ciuill &amp; cannon lawes, that they myght be the better able to diſcerne &amp; iudge of ſuch as were accuſed of hereſie. But becauſe this ſeemed to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer weake a moderation, &amp; tendyng to the abaſing of princes amongſt theyr ſubiects, the inquiſition was a freſh brought in &amp; eſtabliſhed, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t giuen, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the decrees of the councell of <hi>Trent</hi> ſhould be obſerued, &amp; a ſeuere proceeding has, agaynſt the aforeſayd ſupplya<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. Nowe, as the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon people were heereat greatly troubled &amp; perplexed: the nobilitie were determined to declare vnto her highnes the miſchiefe that therupon might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, proteſting y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they had ſufficiently diſcharged the duty of loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſubiects &amp; vaſſals vnto his maieſtye, if for want of ſuch proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion therein as they had deuiſed, any ruine or deſolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhold ariſe vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try.

            <p>This Image was carried about by the worſhipfulleſt men of the Citie, alwayes changing them at certayne quarters and croſſe wayes of the Streetes. There were at that tyme at the prince of Drange his houſe, the Princeſſe his wife, his brother, the count Lewys, and many other Gentlemen to beholde this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne feſtiuall proceſſion. When this ſolemne proceſſion was ended, the Image was ſet vp in the midſt of the Church as it was wonted to be, where it was accuſtomed to ſtande, vntill the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday following. But becauſe my maſters of the Chapiter feared ſome diſorder to come, by reaſon of certayne wordes that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people ſpake in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> proceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſaying, O Marie Marie, the Carpenters wife, this ſhall he thy laſt feſtiuall day, ſhee was

            <p>The 19. of Auguſt, the Prince departed from Antwerpe,
<note place="margin">The prince of Orange his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>Nowe, as they continued in maner and fourme as aforeſaide in their common and publike Sermons, certaine of lowe Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders began to put downe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Idols and Images, which thing was proſecuted in many Cities of the Countrey, and amongſt the reſt at Antwerpe, with ſuch aſſuraunce and diligence, as if ſome man had had expreſſe commandement from the Magiſtrate to execute ſuche an exployte with expedition. This defacing of Images was the morrowe after that the Prince was gone from Antwerp to Bruxelles, which was on Teweſday, being the 20. of Auguſt about ſixe of the clocke in the after noone: And the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion hereof grew by this meane, that the Sunday next before, as afore is ſayde, a great Image of the virgin Marie was caried about in ſolemne proceſſion, which was wonted to be ſet vp and left in a certayne place of the Temple for eyght dayes together, about which euery man and woman according to their deuotion, crept on their knees two or three times: and on the Teweſday following the Prieſtes, hauing ſhutte vp the Church doores, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced her agayne in her ordinary roome. And about two of the clocke in the afternoone, there came to our Ladies Church cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne Mariners, and other yong fellowes, and merueiling that they had ſo often remoued the Image, cryed out and ſayde, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, crie <hi>vine les Gueux,</hi> that is, God ſaue the Gueſes, wee will giu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They aſked alſo the woman that was wonted to ſell the waxe candles, and gather vp the offrings, why they had ſo often remooued the ſaide Image: and ſayde further vnto her that ſhee might nowe ſhutte vp her Shoppe well inough, for there were none that woulde buie any of her marchandize.</p>
            <p>The woman, mooued and grieued with theſe woordes, caſt
<pb facs="tcp:11838:22"/>the Aſhes which ſhee had there in a pot into their eyes. Whiles they were thus ieſting and ſporting, there went to the Towne houſe two ſubſtanciall men, and tolde the Magiſtrate of theſe tumultes and vprores: The Magiſtrate amazed with theſe newes, went to the Colledge, and comming thence, after he had pauſed there a while, he went with the Margraue, accompanied with foure Seriantes, foure Halberdiers, and a great trayne of people vnto the Church: And when the Boyes and young Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes ſawe the Magiſtrate, they went out of the Churche, and then beganne the Magiſtrate to vſe theſe diſcreete ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, vnto the people, ſaying: My good friendes, I pray you get you hence, howebeit there was neuer a man that woulde once ſtyrre, ſo that hee was fayne to gette him out without any more to doe.</p>
            <p>Soone after, the young fellowes aforeſayde came backe to the Church with one of the captaynes of the Guarde of the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, &amp; ſhutting in the Church doores fel a ſinging of Pſalmes, which Pſalmes being ſung, euery man bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to pull down &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face the Images, in ſo much that the very ſame night they had throwen downe the Images not onely in the great temple, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led our Lady Church, but alſo in all the reſt: yea and in all chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels, &amp; Cloyſters: where they made very great vnwonted caues, as if they would haue drowned the Hoggeſheades of wine and beare, after they had drunke more then ynough, and carried away all the ſtoore of fleſhe and of other prouiſion whiche they coulde lay handes on: Howebeit there were none that did thus, but beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, women, and wilde headed young fellowes. And beſides, they deliuered out of priſon in the couente of the Franciſcane Fryers, a poore Fryer that had been kept in priſon 12. yeeres for the preaching of the trueth, and deliuered alſo a French Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker: who had been a yeere and an halfe in the towne Pryſon, for the religion, and confeſſion of the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>The Wedneſday and Thurſday following, the worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full companies of liueries, or brotherhoodes that had their Alter or Chappell in the aforeſaide Ladie Church, beganne to pull downe that, that remayned, and carried it out of the Churche, whereupon, there were others that followed them in the ſame
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:11838:22"/>Church, and alſo in the reſt, to pull downe alſo that whiche they had leaft, and this was done as if they had had commiſſion to doe it, the Magiſtrate not once ſetting him ſelfe agaynſt them to defende it, vntill at the laſt it came to paſſe, that his Maieſties Armes were broken. But when the Magiſtrate hearde of that,
<note place="margin">The kings arms broken.</note> the Borroughmaſter Stralen entered into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church, with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne number of Mariners, all ſhot, who diſcharging their pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, draue away all the Beggers, and ſo ſhutte vp the Churche doores.</p>
            <p>The Teweſday in the euening, the chiefe officers being troubled with theſe beginninges, deſired one of the miniſters of the Flemmiſh Church, to goe to the Temple, and exhorte thoſe that had broken downe the Images, to leaue off. Whereunto hee obeyed, and going vp into the pulpit to that ende, ſpake vnto them. But when he ſawe that they woulde giue no eare vnto him, hee, for the auoyding of a greater miſchiefe, departed. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe, they of the religion were charged with this violence. Whereupon alſo, they were blamed for robberies, and other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolences which thereon had enſued.</p>
            <p>Inregarde whereof, the ſayde miniſter Herman Stryc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of Swelle, went vp agayne into the pulpit of the ſayde Lady Church, on Thurſday in the morning, being the 22. of Auguſt, and there, made a ſhorte collation vnto the people, proteſting in the firſt place, that this violence of pulling downe of the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, was done without the knowledge of the miniſters, and the reſt who had the charge of the Churche committed vnto them: and in the ſeconde place, diſalowyng and deteſting the ſpoyles, pilferies, and other inſolences that had enſued: and exhorted all ſuch as had any of the pillage and ſpoyle, to carrie it to the Magiſtrate.</p>
            <p>And to knit vp the matter withall, he admoniſhed the people of the obedience that was due to the Magiſtrate, and of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde and peace requiſite amongſt the people.</p>
            <p>With this exhortation were many moued, &amp; deliuered vp into the hands of the Magiſtrate, not only ſiluer croſſes, but alſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny gilt chalices, &amp; other iewels, telling their names, ſurnames, and dwelling places, offring them ſelues to become pryſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This Teweſday being the 20. of Auguſt, a great number of the Citizens of Antwerp, both Fleminges and Walons, had made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues ready to goe in the morning to Bruxels towards the Dutches of Parma, Ladie Regent of the lowe Countrey, to the ende to beſeeche her that they might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>WHen they of the Religion heard that they were forbidden the occuping of theſe foure Churches aboue ſpecified, they
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:11838:24"/>had conceiued this opinion, that the Magiſtrate woulde bee contented at the leaſt to winke, at the ſeruing of their turnes with the reſt of the Churches. Wherefore they that ſpake Fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, would needes preach on ſunday morning being the 24. of Auguſt at the Borough Churche, and the Walonnes meant to preach at the Iacopins.</p>
            <p>But the very ſame morning, there came two Gentlemen from the Prince, ſhewing them, that they muſt at no hande haue recourſe to anie of the Churches, howebeit that the chiefe Officers coulde bee contented that they ſhoulde meete together in the newe Towne. And for this purpoſe they deputed one of the Sberiffes to goe and appoynt the wardes to ſuffer the people peaceably to paſſe as they went to the Sermon in that place.</p>
            <p>But forſomuchas the Fleminges were already aſſembled in great multitudes in the ſaide Churches, it was thought beſte to let them alone for that morning, vppon condition that they ſhoulde in the Afternoone, goe to the Sermon in the newe Towne, as the Walonnes did. Who beeing not as yet gotten into the Iacopins (for they kepte the doores ſhut vppon them, when as they heard that there was a diſcharge brought, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhoulde not come in any Church) aſſembled themſelues in the new Towne, by the authoritie and permiſſion of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate.</p>
            <p>Nowe, at that tyme was greete trouble in Antwerpe, as well by reaſon of the pulling downe of the Images, as alſo in regarde of the publique Sermons, whiche then ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in ſteede of Maſſes: Inſomuche that the whole Citie kepte almoſte continuall watche and warde, and the Gates, and ſhoppes thereof were cloſe ſhutte vppe.

            <p>For the bringing of which to paſſe, he cauſed two gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to require at the handes of the two Churches, to witte, the
<pb facs="tcp:11838:25"/>Fleminges and Walonnes, to depute ech of them, foure wiſe &amp; ſkilfull perſonages, who ſhould communicate with his excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, what meanes were beſt to appeaſe &amp; aſſure the people both of the one religion and of the other.</p>

            <p>In the meane while,
<note place="margin">The L.

Ouer and beſides, that the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and ſeuere Commiſſions ſhoulde from thence foorth, bee aboliſhed, ſo that no man ſhoulde any more be purſued, and bunted after, for his conſcience: But yet vpon this condition, that the confedered Gentlemen, which tooke no parte, ſhoulde ſweare, that they woulde procure the people to forſake and lay downe theyr armour and weapon, and that the Churches ſhould bee no more ſpoyled, nor any thing that ſhoulde bee preiudiciall vnto the Cleargie men, or Catholikes.</p>
            <p>To be ſhort, that they ſhould be ready to yeelde all obedience vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Maieſtie. Hereupon an accord was made in Auguſt <hi>1566.</hi> Duer and beſides this, the Regent had procured the moſt qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Catholikes to bee ſworne to the ſame, and confirmed by his Maieſties commaundement, which was proclaymed in diuers places.</p>
            <p>The noble men, for the perfourming of their promiſe and oth, wrote and declared to the Conſiſtories, all thoſe thynges
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:11838:34"/>which had been treated of, which was, that they ſhould lay down and leaue off their armour and weapon, and behaue themſelues, as good and obedient ſubiects ought to doe, towards their pryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for if they ſo did not, the matter would goe yll with them: whereupon, the people, to ſhew theyr obedience, willingly leaft off, and layd downe theyr weapons.</p>
            <p>During theſe troubles, king Philip being aduertiſed by his ſuborners, and flatterers, of the pulling downe, and breaking, of the images, was marueilouſly angry, &amp; determined, in his owne perſon to come downe into the lowe countryes with a mayne force for the auengyng of the contempt and miſbehauiour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and doone vnto his mateſtie. But before hee had called together his councel at <hi>Madrid,</hi> to conſult about the appeaſing of the low countries, it was concluded that his maieſtie ſhoulde not goe thyther, becauſe that this ſire, might otherwiſe, bee well enough quenched by force of armes, howbeit, as for the cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of a generall that ſhould execute the ſame, they were of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie opinions. For, many were of the opinion, that the prince of Spaine <hi>Don Charles,</hi> his maieſties onely ſonne and heyre, ſhould bee appointed generall, not onely for that that by right of nature it apperteined vnto him, but alſo by reaſon of the good affection which the catholikes of the lowe countries be are hym, as beeyng theyr naturall prince, and the onelye ſonne of the kyng theyr Lorde, vnto whom they would ſooner yeelde theyr obedience, and loue, then to any other.

The young prince being aduertiſed of this reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, was greatly greeued and deſpited therewith, and for that cauſe conceaued a marueilous great harred againſt the Duke of <hi>Alua,</hi> and other Lordes: which beeing once knowen together his good affection that hee had, to the lowe countries, was the cauſe of his death, as heereafter more at large ſhalbee decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
            <p>Whiles they were about to make readie for this warre,
<note place="margin">The kings let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters vnto the ladie Regent</note> his mateſtie wrote to the ladie <hi>Regent,</hi> and to other chiefe Lords

            <p>Hereupon, the confederates might eaſily conſider, &amp; gather, to what ende this preparation of warre and yrefull threates of his maieſtie tended, but the Catholikes eſpecially, who with theyr craftie clayning and ſubtill dawbing might the eaſilier deceiue the Regent, feigned that they wold rather become new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or els if they did any thing, that they would after a ſort take part with her excellencie (as they ſaide) for the common wealth, and yet it was well enough perceiued, that they ſhewed them ſelues ſecrete enemies, both to the Inquiſition, and alſo to the Spaniardes: howbeit, becauſe they hoped to obteine the good will and moderation, whiche the Regent on the behalfe of her brother, had giuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vnderſtand, they to the end, they would not haue their enterpriſes to bee diſcouered nor hindered, fell to plaine diſſembling. But when both the confederates and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes, vnderſtoode of the rumor of the ſetting forwarde of the Spaniſhe warres, eyther partie beganne to beſtyrre hym, and make ſhift for himſelfe: yea, and ſome of the Proteſtants, who before had refuſed and forſaken the gentle offer and ayde of ſtrange captaines and ſouldiers, becauſe they woulde ſtreng then themſelues the better, confirmed with them their confederacie, and thereupon cauſed men to bee leuied who had taken and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed certaine townes, makyng thereby the Romaniſtes practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of none effect, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now, becauſe the ſpoyle of the Churches greatly diſpleaſed the Catholikes, they alſo leuied a great number of men of war, that they might bee auenged of the downe pullers and breakers of theyr Images, puniſhyng many in diuers places, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing at all gainſaid by any of the reſt of the proteſtants. For the third part of the confederates, haunted no whit any of the aſſemblies, but interdicting alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preachings, impriſoned as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as continued conſtant in the exerciſe of religion, rechriſtening the infants, and remarrying thoſe perſons, which by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:11838:35"/>had been before baptiſed and marryed: and beſides, when they had cauſed the preachings to ceaſe, they hunted and chaſed the miniſters, and gaue them vp vnto the Inquiſition, and to all the reſt of the old ordenances. Whereupon, many were forced to get them away into other countries, and cities, where the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the religion had free courſe: amongeſt which, <hi>Valencia</hi> was the moſt famous.</p>
            <p>For this cauſe, the Lady <hi>Regent</hi> had required and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the <hi>Valencians</hi> to take in a garriſon: to wit, fiue enſignes of footemen, and foure troupes or companies of horſemen, whiche, <hi>Monſieur de Noircarmes,</hi> the Marques of <hi>Bergues</hi> lieuetenant Gouernour of <hi>Henault</hi> had brought.

For, although your maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie hath beene alwayes councelled and induced, to purſue by moſt cruell death, and loſſe of goods, as many as will not in all points receiue the doctrine of the Romiſhe Church, as alſo hath of late beene propounded and ſet foorth by the councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> thereby to maintaine the inquiſition, where it was firſt planted, and to bring it into other places, where it was neuer before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, beeing a deuiſe wholy againſt the liberties and priuileges of your lowe countries hereabouts, and alſo your faithful ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects in them.

                        <p>Now, the people hauing been as it were a long time brought into ſlauerie, by keeping of the ſaid commiſſions, and yet hauing ſecretely very well profited in the true knowledge of their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, as well by reading of the holy Scriptures inſpired by God, as alſo by the teaching and exhorting of certaine good and godly Preachers, well inſtructed both in diuinitie and humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, beeyng moued by the continuall ſlaunders and falſe accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſome euill willers, who neuer ceaſed to cauſe them to bee ſuſpected of theyr religion, knewe not, nor could not any longer hyde it: and therefore for the ſhutting vp of the mouthes of all Backbiters and ſtaunderers, and the ſatiſfiyng and contenting of themſelues by ſhewing theyr owne zeale and feruencie, they went to the publike exerciſes of the ſaid religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to the end euery man might know, what the religion was, which they before ſo ſecretely vſed amongeſt themſelues, which beeing done, there met ſuch great numbers of men ſo well qualified at the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies and preachings, as that they could hardly bee counted, and the matter more hardly bee beleeued of thoſe, that were not

But although the myniſters in their Sermons greatly trauelled in exhorting the people to all modeſtie, and dutiful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence and obedience vnto the magiſtrate, and in preaching, namely, againſt idolatry, admoniſhed them to conteine them ſelues within the boundes of their vocation, without vſurping of the ſaide magiſtrates office, by thruſting themſelues forewarde to the pulling downe of Images and ſuch like things: yet it ſo fell out, as that certaine companies of people, carried with an ouer hoat and indiſcrete zeale, amongeſt whom were ſome diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and wicked perſons, who looked after nothing but ſpoyling and pilfring, &amp; accompanied with a multitude of wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, young youthes and children, gaue themſelues to the pulling downe of the Images in the Churches, and ſuch other like diſorders, to our vnſpeakle griefe, whereupon the magiſtrates euery where, were in ſuch a fright and feare, becauſe they doubted of more grieuous inconueniences as that they did not onelie let them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but which is more, commanded the companies of Liueries or Brotherhoods in many places to take away the Images and ornaments of theyr aulters, whiche coulde not be done ſo haſtily and confuſedly, but that they muſt needes breake ſome of them. Which kinde of dealing, when ſome of the people ſawe, they in like ſort put thereto theyr helping hand, thinking it to be a thing both lawfull, allowed, and alſo commaunded by the magiſtrate to ryd the Churches of them all. Wherefore, it is ſo farre of that they were neither at the firſt, nor yet afterwardes ſtirred vp thereto by the Sermons, as that contrariwiſe the Preachers, and ſuch as haue the gouernment of the Churche, as muche as in them lay, trauelled to ſtay them, neuer hauing commaunded any ſuch act to bee doone, nor yet knowing thereof before, eyther els allowyng of it after, as by many reaſons may wel bee verified, and alſo namely appeare by the teſtimonie of a very great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of pryſoners, who for the ſame cauſe haue beene miſerably tormented.

And withall that the ſaying of <hi>Gamaliel</hi> may well bee weighed, That if it bee of God, it cannot bee ouerthrowne: and therefore an hard and dangerous matter to make warre againſt him. And that which is more, when your maieſtie ſhall ſee into the chiefe pointes of the enterpriſes that haue beene put into your head, by ſuche, as eyther through ignorance, by theyr particuler affections, or for feare, haue giuen you that councell, that none other thing will followe nor come thereon, but an irrecouerable ruine and deſtruction of your ſo floriſhing lowe Countries, and ſo neceſſary for the conſeruation of your migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe, and the increaſing of the Princes your neighbours, who beeynge inriched with the ſpoyles of theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, may thereby bee ſtrengthened to make warre againſt you.</p>

            <p>The 16. of Februarie 1567, the Ladie <hi>Regent</hi> anſwered the ſaid ſupplication in maner and forme following. I cannot a little maruel, ne yet thinke what noble men, or people theſe are, which exhibite vnto vs this ſupplication: ſeeing that many of the Lords confedered are contented, that not only the inquiſition and commiſſions ſhould hee obſerued, but are alſo well pleaſed with the aſſurance that is promiſed them: and therfore doe daily offer vp vnto his maieſtie their humble ſeruices and obedience: And ſhe herſelfe alſo thinketh it very ſtrange, that they can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade themſelues, that it was euer her highnes wyl &amp; meaning, to graunt vnto the exerciſe of the religion, ſeeing ſhe had giuen it out ſufficiently enough to be other wiſe vnderſtoode, by the article of the agreement: although it was contrary to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> promiſe that ſome of the nobilitie made to the people, touching the faide exerciſe, which was plainely againſt her well and intent. And whereas the L. L. deſired that all leuiyng of ſouldiers, ſhoulde ceaſe, and be caſt, ſo likewiſe ought they to bee contented to haue the auncient religion, without bringing in any new, whereunto ſhe neuer agreed.</p>
            <p>Ouer and beſides this, if they did well remember themſelues, with what grudging and griefe of minde the preachings were in diuers places ſuffered, without taking of offences and giuing of blowes, they might eaſily gheſſe, what ſmall pleaſure ſhe tooke in fauouring the preachings, I will not ſpeake of the reſt of the exerciſes of the religion. But ſo much as concerned y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> liberty of conſcience, I agreed onely to that, and graunted the ſame that was conteyned in their ſupplication, exhibited the fifth of Aprill the yeere laſt paſt, howbeit at that time, was no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made of the cauſe of religion, which they contrary to theyr conſcience and duetie ſuffered longe before to enter.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I haue iuſte occaſion to be grieued, ſeeing they
<pb facs="tcp:11838:42"/>haue of their owne authoritie taken vpon them a matter preiudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall and hurefull vnto his maieſtie.</p>
            <p>And therefore had his maieſtie alſo great reaſon to be moued and angry, when as hee was aduertiſed that his ſubiects vſed an other exerciſe of religion, and that, by theyr newe magiſtrates, they had inforced his maieſties officers,
<note place="margin">The Regent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteth the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund of the Gueſes.</note> the doyng whereof they ſhoulde ſhortly feele: and for anſwere thereof, the Dutches dyd them to wit: That they had not obſerued the conditions promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and that theſe ſpeeches are falſe and fained. For, many of the magiſtrates woulde neuer graunt to any ſuch thing: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that ſhee neuer went againſt her promiſes, although they had by her appointme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t impriſoned certain for their faults &amp; offences. For, ſhe was neuer of the minde to deliuer the Church robbers, and pullers downe and breakers of Images, eſpecially ſuche as were put in priſon ſithence the argreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t made with ſom of the nobles confedered.</p>
            <p>Beſides all this, they yet continue theyr preachinges in ſome Cities, where were neuer any before. Moreouer, that they had taken certaine Churches, Monaſteries, and Gentlemens houſes, dryuen out thence the knightes of the order, threatened the Cleargie men, preached in places where in tyme paſt were neuer any, yea, &amp; that the people is ſtyrred vp &amp; encouraged by the confederates, and doe keepe certaine Cities and places be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to his mateſtie, brynging in Artillerie, and munition, depoſe and expulſe his maieſties officers, are come in open field in armes, and haue not onely threatened all the Catholikes, but her highnes alſo.</p>
            <p>And by the intercepting of letters, and the men of warre of <hi>Valencia,</hi> theyr purpoſe is founde out and knowen: to wit, if god had not prouided for it, euen to haue depriued his maieſtie of all his countries. And as for their requeſt about the caſting of the ſouldiers that are leuied, and the commiſſions newly publiſhed, thereby their meaning is to take away the ſword which GOD hath giuen vs.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, her highnes intent is, that the Lord of <hi>Brederode</hi> and his confederates, doe admoniſhe the people of theyr vprore and rebellion, &amp; giue them warning that they take heed they pul not his maieſties wrath more and more vpon their heads.</p>
            <pb n="37" facs="tcp:11838:42"/>
            <p>After that theſe complaintes and anſweres were made, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man on either ſide prouided for him ſelfe as much as was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, but eſpecially the Catholiques, who had the winde in the poupe, inſomuche that the confederates feared them, by reaſon of the great number of ſouldiers that were leuied, and the kinge taking their part.</p>
            <p>The Count of <hi>Megue</hi> was come with certaine enſignes of footemen,

After that, the ſayde Count ſent twelue enſignes about Vtryght to ſurpreſe the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and Towne of <hi>Vyane.</hi> And as manye as were taken pryſoners in all the Countreys, were condemned and puniſhed as rebels and ſeditious perſons, and the deſtroyers of the images were hanged, and their goodes confiſked and forfayted.</p>
            <p>Ouer and beſides, all thoſe that were of the reformed religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or that had frequented the Sermons, were holden for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belles. Wherefore a great number of them conueied themſelues away into ſtraunge Countreys, and chiefely into Englande: But ſome y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were of courage, aſſembled the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues in companies.</p>
            <p>In this meane while, the Lordes and Knightes of the golden Fleeſe, were newely ſworne,
<note place="margin">The league of the knightes of the order.</note> to keepe inuiolably the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique fayth, emongeſt whome a ſecrete league was made by the counſell of the Count <hi>Egmount:</hi> who traueyling through the Cities of Flanders and Artois, where remayned as yet ſome Proteſtauntes, did his beſt to cauſe the Sermous to bee left: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and the Count of <hi>Hoogſtrate</hi> had done at Antwerpe: And about Antwerpe, the Lorde of <hi>Tolonſe</hi> cauſed men of warre to be leuied in the name and behalfe of the Proteſtantes, who by reaſon of the ſcituation and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the place, aſſembled them ſelues at <hi>Ooſterwell,</hi> a ſhorte myle from Antwerpe.</p>
            <p>When the Dutcheſſe vnderſtoode of this, ſhee ſent the 13. of Marche, vnder the conduct of <hi>Hans de Grauedroſſat</hi> of Brabant, foure hundred footemen, and fiue hundred horſe, which were piked out of the Gariſons aſwell of Brabant as of Flaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, who aſſayled and fought with the Proteſtantes, ouerthrew them and put them to flight.

            <p>There were ſlayne at that inſtant their Captayne <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<pb facs="tcp:11838:43"/>de Tolonſe,</hi> and a great manie of others, ſome gotte into the Medowe ditches, thinking thereby to ſaue them ſelues, howebeit they were ſlayne with Harquebuze ſhotte, and ſome of them were burnt vp in the Barnes, and Houſes of <hi>Ooſterwell,</hi> without any reſiſtaunce.</p>
            <p>They tooke alſo a priſoner, who had a ſcrowle of the names of all thoſe that ſubſcribed to the Conſpiracie, by which meane they learned and came to the knowledge of manie ſecrete pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, whereupon alſo enſued very much miſchiefe. When the Proteſtantes of Antwerpe vnderſtood of theſe dealings, they put themſelues in armes, and paſſing by the Meire Bridge, marched on towardes the Gate, that they might get out of the Citie to helpe their people. But my L. the P. of <hi>Orange</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned ſtil in Antwerp, gouernour for his Maieſtie, being here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of aduertiſed, came vnto them, and admoniſhed &amp; counſelled them to leaue off that enterpriſe, ſaying, that it was impoſſible for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ayde the ſouldiers of <hi>Ooſterwell,</hi> and that if ſo be they iſſued out of the Towne, they ſhould taſt of the ſame ſawce, and be laid on Gods deare earth (as we ſay) as the reſt were, becauſe they were too too weake to deale agaynſt Horſemen. But if they woulde abyde in the towne, that theyr bodtes and goods ſhoulde be ſaued, for there ſhoulde no man take any wronge in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
            <p>Whiles the Prince was thus talking with the Citizens,
<note place="margin">A ſedition and tumult in Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werpe.</note> the tumult encreaſed more and more. For both horſemen and foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men had taken and kept the Meire Bridge and the ſtreete called Hauuetters ſtreet, where they continued in armes vntill it was after noone. During theſe troubles, the Prince had talked and agreed with the Magiſtrate and counſell of Antwerpe, that the three companies of the ſouldiers, that were leuied for the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard of the Citie (as before hath been ſaid) which were ranged in order of battayle in the market place, ſhoulde returne home, and the artillery be drawen to the ordinarie place. And although through the good and gentle woordes of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> this tumult and trouble was ſupreſſed, yet renued it agayne, by reaſon y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Italians, Spaniards, &amp; Catholikes, together thoſe of the religion had gotten the Market place on horſebacke: Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that they of the reformed religion, aſſembled themſelues
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:11838:43"/>a freſhe. This ſedition continued two dayes together, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man doubted that ſome miſchieuous iſſue woulde thereon eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue. And as they were all very deſirous to haue one another by the eares, it was feared that there woulde bee a wonderfull great effuſion of blood, and that the victors would ſacke the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſheds houſes: Inſomuch that there was great mourning and weeping of women, and children in euery houſe.</p>
            <p>But as eyther part kept their order of battell, the Prince and the Boroughmaſters traueiled in all they might to agree them,

            <p>Spayne at the firſt was gouerned by meane kings,
<note place="margin">Spaine in olde time gouerned by petie kings</note> and after warde, the greateſt part thereof was conquered by the Affrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes who at laſt peaceably poſſeſſed it, and freed it from the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of the Romanes. After this the ſame Prouince was for a while gouerned by the Uandales and Alanes, whom the Gothes in the dayes of the Emperours Theodoſe, and Ualentinian the thirde, expulſed out of Fraunce, who conquered many Lands and Countreys, deſtroying the Romaine Empire. At laſt theſe wandering people were by the ordinaunce of Boniface, gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours in Affrica, who through the dealing of the other Affricane gouernours, were ſent and called thereto. But as they were by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vice Bothes purſued on this ſide y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſea, there paſſed ouer of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, women, and children, vnder the conduct of Gontram and Genſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke their kings and lordes in the yeere 720. about eyght hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſande perſons, to deſtroy and conquere Affricke. After this retraite of this foreſaid Uandales, the Gothes, by the conſent of the Emperours, gouerned the realme of Spayne, vntill the dayes of K Rodrigue, who hauing violated and defloured Cana, Count Iulians daughter, was ruined &amp; ſlayne, with all his kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. For the ſame count Iulian, in reuenge of the wrong and ſhame that was done him, ſent the Uandales, Mores, Affricanes, and Sarazins, vnder the conduct of Muſa their king, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning diſcomfited and ſlayne in many battels, mo then ſeuen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth thouſand men, conquered all Spayne, and deuided it into diuers kingdomes, to witte, Granade, Ualence, Portugall, To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledo, Cordua, and many others. But the chriſtians which came of Gothes, for the auoyding of the intollerable oppreſſions, and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible furie of theſe nations, retyred and withdre we them ſelues into the Mountaynes of Arragon, who at that tyme were called the Cantabrians, and Aſturians, and choſe one named Pelagius to be their king. This Pelagius forſaking the name of a Gothe, beganne to make very great warres againſt the Mores, but hee had therein but euill ſucceſſe.</p>
            <pb n="42" facs="tcp:11838:47"/>
            <p>Wherefore, his ſucceſſours required ayde and helpe of the French kinges, to witte of Pepin, Charlemeine, Lewis, and many others: ſo that in ſhort tyme the Countreys that were loſt, were conquered agayne, which were deuided into Prouinces, and after into kingdomes, giuing them the names of the fortreſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſes and Townes, whereby they were conquered: to witte, of the Citie or Towne of Leon or Legion, the kingdome of Leon, of Tarracon, Arragon: of Barcinone, Barcelone: of the Caſtle which Pelagius built ſo ſoone as hee had wonne Leon, againſt the aſſault of the Mores, the kingdome of Caſtile: and after all this, the kingdomes of Portugall, Nauarre, Galice, Toledo, Ualence, Cordua and Granade, were exected: to wit, when the Mores were enforced to become ſubiecte to Chriſtian kings and Countreys, at ſuche tyme as euery one warred againſt them in his owne Countrey, the chiefe of which were the Arragonians and Caſtilians.</p>
            <p>Nowe amongſt all the Princes and Potentates that warred vpon the heathen and Infidelles, Ferdinando king of Arragon was the moſt famous. But after that the Countrey was out of the daunger of the Mores, by reaſon of the happie ſucceſſe of the heathen warres, the ſayde king Ferdinando ſuffered the Mores (as his predeceſſors had alſo done) to liue in quiet ſubiection and obedience, paying certayne tribute: Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe their kinde of life was paynefull, eſpecially amongſt thoſe that were freemen, and yet tollerable inough, ſeeing they were not troubled or moleſted for the cauſe of religion.</p>
            <p>But as the thinges of this worlde neuer continue in one ſelfe and the ſame eſtate, and that the heartes of kinges and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces doe often chaunge, which cauſeth the ſubiectes for the preſent tyme to be ouercharged and burdened: There were ſome that perſwaded the ſayde king to choſe certayne perſonnes, who ſhoulde haue an eye to their many ſuperſtitions and infidelities, to the ende the Mahometiſhe and Ieweſhe religion, myght not any way derogate from the Catholique Religion.</p>
            <p>Neuertheleſſe wee ſee by experience, that oftentimes they whiche make pittes for others, fall them ſelues into them: For it is an harde matter to ſtumble againſt a ſtone: when
<pb facs="tcp:11838:48"/>as they will labour to reduce others to their opinion and fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. The king had appoynted for this purpoſe the moſte quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied men, following therein the order of his predeceſſors: And as a king careth not what payne hee ordinarily taketh to excell all other kinges and Monarches in honour and fame: Euen ſo this king Ferdinand purpoſed and concluded to ſhewe him ſelfe a no leſſe true and politike, then a warlike Chriſtian: for, in lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing all his warlike affayres, he beſtowed all his care about the aduauncing of chriſtian Religion, which is a moſt good kingly deede, and worthy great commendation: as alſo it is the parte and duetie of a king, who is the Image of the moſt excellent and Almightie king, to vſe Iuſtice and true mercie vnto his ſubiects. In doing whereof he hath been moſt happie and bleſſed, and is a figne of a true teſtimonie of that name which the Pope gaue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him and to his ſucceſſors kings of Spaine, to wit, the title of moſt Catholike king: which Pope Gregory, the thirde of that name graunted the yeere 1230. To <hi>Alfonſe</hi> king of Galice, who alſo hath giuen to all Spaniardes the tytles of double Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike.</p>
            <p>Nowe, this thing was the cauſe that all the Mores, Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zins, and the Iewes them ſelues, who (as the Hiſtories witneſſe) fithens the ſacking and deſtruction of Ieruſalem, hauing by the appoyntment of the Emperour Titus continued in theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, haue withdrawne them ſelues out of Spayn: becauſe they were enforced to beleeue &amp; confeſſe Ieſus Chriſt to be the ſonne of God, and therefore forſooke they the Countrey, &amp; ſought out for themſelues ſome other better place to dwell in:: Inſomuch that many thouſandes haue gotten them away vnto the borders of <hi>Gibalter,</hi> and from thence into <hi>Affricque,</hi> &amp; into diuers other places.</p>
            <p>But the reſt who like well of Spayne, continue there ſtill, and both themſelues and their children are baptiſed. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles, not long after, when the ſpaniards perceiued, how great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the opinion of the Godhead, whether it be good or bad, taking once impreſſion in mens imaginations, preuayled, and what force it hath in mens harts, when it is once rooted therin, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when in long proceſſe of time it is ſucceſſiuely learned from one to another: for then they will become obſtinate, and neuer
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:11838:48"/>forgoe it: Then was the exerciſe of the Iewiſh Religion forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den them: and as they coulde not in trueth forgette and forgoe the ſayde exerciſe, the Spaniardes fell to perſecuting of them, and yet by a certayne kinde of Iuſtice, meaning vtterly to roote them out: But it was impoſſible to roote out ſuche a people ſo obſtinately bent and ſetteled in their Infidelitie.</p>
            <p>A little before this, there was a newe order of Fryers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by a Spaniarde,
<note place="margin">The beginning of the order of the Iacopins.</note> borne within the Dyoceſſe of <hi>Lexo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,</hi> to witte, in <hi>Caliroga,</hi> named Dominicke: whiche was called the order of the <hi>lacopins,</hi> and authorized by Pope <hi>Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> the thirde of that name, the yeere 1216. And this was brought in, by reaſon of a viſion that appeared to him as hee lay a ſleepe, by which was ſhewed him that the Churche being ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and readie to fall, was helde vp by Saint Dominicke onely, albeeit Pope Innocente the thyrde his predeceſſor had no will to yeelde to the Inſtitution and exection of that order of Fryers.</p>
            <p>This Religious order is growen into ſuche credite, and ſo highly eſteemed of, as that the king of Spaine, hath committed vnto the <hi>Iacopins</hi> all the affayres concerning conſcience, and religion: and although there was before tyme a certayne forme and manner of Inquiſition inſtituted, yet was it by this order of the <hi>Iacopins,</hi> whiche was thought to be the moſt holy of all the reſt, confirmed and eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>For when they ſawe that the Iewes, coulde neyther by the prayers, preachings, and admonitions of the <hi>Iacopins,</hi> bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted: they then proceeded with them after a rigorous ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and tooke vpon them the ſwoorde to force them to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, if ſo bee they woulde not depart and gette them out of the countrey.</p>
            <p>This rodde or ſwoorde whereof I heere intende to ſpeake, whiche the <hi>Iacopins</hi> vnto this preſent haue vſurped agaynſte theſe poore people, hath been the cauſe, as it is ſayde, that the Inquiſition beganne in the dayes of King Ferdinand whileſt hee raigned: Becauſe that this manner and fourme of Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is more rigorous then the firſt was, againſt thoſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies and heretiques, which they called Marans:
<note place="margin">The originall of the marans.</note> which name is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſed amongſt many Chriſtian nations againſt ſuch as of a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
<pb facs="tcp:11838:49"/>deſire wiſhe to haue a newe religion, forſaking and reiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the olde, whereupon the originall of the Marans was but a litle before that knowne. For, as the Iewes looked for the promiſed Meſſias, and had alwayes in their mouthes this name Maran, to witte, Our Lorde: Euen ſo the Iewes which had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued the Chriſtian fayth, ſayde Maranathi, that is to ſay, The Lorde is come.</p>
            <p>Shortly after, there aroſe a diſſention and ennemitie amongſt the Chriſtians, to witte, betweene the true Chriſtians, and thoſe which denied that the ſayde ſauyour was come, who were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Marans, and condemned for a pernitious and wicked ſect.</p>
            <p>This is the cauſe why the Iewes had alwayes that name in their mouthes, and that the Spaniardes on the other ſide called them Apoſtates and heretiques, which woorde they alſo vſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſte all ſuche as helde not the true doctrine of the Romiſhe Church.</p>
            <p>And therefore the <hi>Iacopins</hi> were the authours of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, who deuiſed a better forme thereof, then that, that was before. The king foorth with ratified this forme, and Pope Sextus the Genoway confirmed it. Without all doubt, the king had great occaſion to doe this, for the rooting out of the wicked and reprobate doctrine of the Mahometiſtes and Iewes, who went about none other thing but to burden mens conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, with the looking for the promiſed Meſſias: and beſides, the Sarazins and Arabians, whiche the Mores had ſent into Spayne, committed great miſchiefe. Yea and the Iewes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues were condemned by Pope Sextus the yeere 1475. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had crucified a childe of two yeeres of age, cutting off his genitories and ryght pappe,
<note place="margin">The Iewes put to death a child of two yeeres <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>Theſe <hi>Iacopins,</hi> by reaſon of the reputation whiche they had gotten by the ſetting vp of their newe order of Religion, called them ſelues, the defenders of the Chriſtian doctrine and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:11838:49"/>Religion, not onely in Spayne, but alſo in Italy, and in other places of Chriſtendome, where they had brought in, and planted their order. The firſt commiſſion they had, was graunted them againſt the Iewes and Mahometiſts: but after, when their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie encreaſed, and extended it ſelfe further, then they called themſelues the Inquiſitors of Heretikes, for the perſecuting of all ſuch, as woulde not obſerue the ordinaunces and inſtitutions of the Catholike religion. Nowe, that we might knowe what kynde of men theſe Inquiſitors haue beene, Experience hath ſhewed vnto vs, to wit, ſuch me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as through their wickednes haue peruerted all thinges. For theſe good Gentlemen proceede e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as they are affected againſt the accuſed, whiche is the cauſe that all men bate them: eſpecially ſithence the agreement whiche the Pope made betweene the foure orders of begging Fryers: And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe of this controuerſie was, by reaſon y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the inquiſitors had examined certain diuines of the order of the Carmelites vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome articles of the faith, of which number was Iulian of Breſſe in Lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bardie, a very famous doctor and preacher, &amp; another called <hi>Peter de Nouellans,</hi> in whoſe behalf <hi>Mantua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> hath writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Apollogie, containing foure bookes.</p>
            <p>The Pope conſideryng to what ende this partiall dealing and partaking woulde come, and that it woulde tende to the hurt and diſhonour of either partie, yea euen to the hurt &amp; greate loſſe of the Eccleſiaſticall ſtate, ſeeyng that eyther partie was grounded vpon a matter of ſmal importance, and that this diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might in time to come bring great damage to all the orders of begging Fryers, emongſt whome the <hi>Iacopins</hi> were the chiefe and moſt eſteemed, and preſumed of them ſelues to be the beſt, it was ordeyned at the inſtance &amp; earneſt ſute of Chriſtopher Martignes, that they ſhoulde in all places bee a like as touching the priuileges &amp; immunities which the Pope had graunted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Neuertheleſſe, the commiſſion of the Inquiſition had pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ured them hatred, and made them become ſo odious, as that many greatly ſuſpected them, becauſe they alone had to doe with the office of the Inquiſition.</p>
            <p>In the ende, king Ferdinande was forced of neceſſitie, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe this diſcorde and diſcention: Howebeit he very louingly, &amp; honourably placed in their ſtead very learned popiſh clergymen,
<pb facs="tcp:11838:50"/>who had long before fauoured this Inquiſition. And to the ende the Woorſhipfull Iacopins ſhould not take this depriua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and depoſing of their eſtate in ill part, the king had authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed them that they might be preſent in councel, and at the delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and iudgements of the Fathers Inquiſitors of the faith: Inſomuch y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they may haue at this day to do with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> examination: And although they haue rather loſt the eſtimation and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding then their being forgotten, whiche brought them into ſo great reputation with euerie man: yet for al that, they hold not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of Inquiſitors ſtil, with good hope y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they are not ſo farre from the matter but that they may one day reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the ſame eſtate and dignity.</p>
            <p>I haue heretofore told you howe the Inquiſition came to bee exected in Spain, and although as then it was not ſo rigorouſly adminiſtred and put in execution, as it is at this preſent: yet had not the Spaniards themſelues any good will to receiue it, no more then many other ſubiectes beſides. For when the kyng of <hi>Arragon</hi> woulde haue brought the Inquiſition into his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,
<note place="margin">Arragon will not receiue the inquiſition.</note> The Eſtates &amp; nobles of the countrie there, very reuerent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gayneſaide, and ſet themſelues againſt it: Firſt by words and Supplycations: But when hee woulde haue inforced them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, then they oppoſed themſelues againſt it in deede, and woulde in no wiſe accept of it: Becauſe the Eſtates conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that ſuch an Inquiſition woulde bee hurtfull and pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the libertie of the kingdome: Inſomuche that it was not onely broughte in by a liuely force, but alſo with great effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of blood, as well on the one ſide as on the other, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by the death of maiſter <hi>Aepile,</hi> who was ſent with full au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie from the king, to bring the Inquiſition into the Realme of <hi>Arragon:</hi> for the which hee was ſlayue and maſſacred in the Catheorall Church of <hi>Sarragouſe.</hi>
            </p>

Afterward, they ſende to the Curate or Biſhoppe of the place or Dioceſſe, where the accuſed dwelleth, to the end they would not vnadutſedly lay handes vppon the ſillie lambe of a ſtraunge ſhepheard: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſend vnto him and tell him, that they haue one of his ſheepe in the pound, but if by aduenture the Priſoner breake out of priſon, they ſend letters to the Tippeſtaffe or Marſhals Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liff, ſignifiyng vnto him the faſhion and features of the face, and other circumſtances of the fugitiue priſoner, who followeth him in euery place where he thinketh to find him, vntill ſuch time as he hath found him, taken him, and brought him backe to priſon. This purſute is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly made after ſuch as are of great eſtate, or very learned men, whom they feare wil forſake the catholike faith. When the accuſed is brought againe to priſon, they call for the keyes of his houſe, and deliuer them vnto a publique notary, who muſt make an Inuentory of al his moueables, letters, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, &amp; iewels that are within his houſe: which Inuentory is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered into the hands of one of his rich neighbours, who keepeth it vntil the ſute be ended: and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the accuſed is condemned, and iudged for an Heretike, then all his goods are forfaited for the behoofe of the king. For the cuſtome is, although the ſentence be not capitall, that all his goodes ſhalbe as a deuided ſpoile, by reaſon of the hereſie, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the accuſed is not worthy to inioy his goodes, but are adiudged to bee the kinges, by the Popes graunt.
<pb facs="tcp:11838:51"/>The Gaoler, ſo ſoone as the accuſed is committed to ward, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of him, and diligently ſearcheth, whether hee haue anye knife, paper, or ſuch other like thing about him: and ranſacketh and ſearcheth him euen to his ſhirt. Eight dayes after, the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors ſuborne the Baoler, to counſell the Priſoner, inſtantlye to pray, that he may haue a day of hearing, and the priſoner beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the Gaoler, to craue it in his name, which thing hee doeth. Now, when the priſoner commeth to be hearde, he beſeecheth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to make a ſhort ſute of it: The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is admoniſhed to diſcharge his conſcience, and acknowledge his faultes, promiſing him all the fauour and mercy that poſſibly may be had, if he wil conuert. And if he confeſſe it, he is neuer a whit y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſooner deliuered ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, as you may here vnderſtand. But if he will not confeſſe his fault, he is carried backe to priſon, and the Inquiſitors will tell him, that they will make a ſhort ſute of it. Then hee hath agayne audience graunted him, but nothing is done, neither will they tel him wherefore hee is accuſed, becauſe their meaning is, to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw him by his owne confeſſion.</p>
            <p>After this, he is once more brought before the Inquiſitors, who giue him very hard ſpeeches, and ſaye: If thou wilt not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe aunſweare, and diſcharge thy conſcience, thou ſhalte bee committed to the Attorney generall, who will handle thee after another manner, &amp; faſhion, to wit, he will ſhrewdly put thee to thy trumpe and triall. For, his purpoſe, is firſt of all to make a forfaiture of the goodes of the accuſed, for the kinges behoofe. But when the cunning admonitions of the Inquiſitors cannot make him confeſſe, nor yet winne him from his perſeuerance &amp; conſtancie, they then practize another way with him. For, then they cauſe a croſſe &amp; maſſe booke to be brought, &amp; laying y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hand of the accuſed vpon them, would put him to his othe, but if he wil not ſweare, he is already conuinced, &amp; if he doe ſweare, then they make dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſearch what countrey man he is, what his friends, his profeſſion, &amp; companions are, &amp; other ſuch like, by which they draw &amp; gather great argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts &amp; toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. But ſuch as are wiſe and cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning, wil not giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one word to anſwer, becauſe they before hand ſee y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> informatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and ſifting of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter, whereof they are accuſed. In the ende the Action is deliuered him in writing, that he may defend himſelfe by his attorney and counſeller, who
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:11838:51"/>calleth vnto hym the pryſoner, and taketh vpon him the defenſe of his cauſe, and after that the ſute is ſet forwarde accordyng to the cuſtome, hee addeth vnto it in writing, what the lawe is, exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting the ſame into the hands of the Inquiſitors, who, the third day after, ſende againe for the pryſoner and his counſellour, to come before them: then they commaund hym to tel the trueth, ſeeing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in that auditorie they deſire nothyng els: But if he will confeſſe nothing, they carry him backe to pryſon, and at laſte the depoſitions are ſhewed him, without naming the witneſſes: But if any man will depoſe any thyng againſt him, the pryſoner enquireth of the qualitie and condition of the perſon: and it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth alſo many times to paſſe, that the Inquiſitors are of the opinion with the pryſoner accuſed, that if he can geſſe or imagine who is his accuſer, by calling to minde, with whom hee had any talke of matters of religion, that the ſame man ought to brought before him, and accuſe him face to face. They that are ſubtill &amp; cunning will call for a copie of the action, that they may anſwer it by writing. But if there are two witneſſes, they may then without all doubt giue iudgement and ſentence of death agaynſt the pryſoner: and one witnes is ſufficient to put him to a ſhrewd trumpe or tryall. The aduocate Fiſ kall pleadeth the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the accuſers are the witneſſes. Two or three dayes after, when as the pryſoner is againe ſent for to come before the Inquiſitors, his councellour ſheweth vnto him the principall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles whereof he is accuſed, and ſetteth downe vnto him the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancialleſt reaſons and teſtimonies of his accuſers, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of them whether they are like to bee true or not: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, he hiddeth the pryſoner to be wel aduiſed, to ſee if he can be able to bring it to paſſe to vnderſtand what they are that haue wit neſſed matter againſt him, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might challenge them: for doing whereof, certaine dayes of deliberatton are giuen to the priſoner to record with himſelfe, who or what his enemies be, which are able to depoſe againſt him, and lay any thing to his charge: and if he cannot deuiſe who they ſhould be, God haue mercy on him, for he hath then no more to ſay. But if he can geſſe what they are or name the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, no man telleth him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is they, but his councellour telleth it to him ſecretly, &amp; then he is aſked before the inquiſitors, by what way or meane hee is able to challenge the accuſer. And beſides, if hee woulde excuſe and purge himſelfe or that hee bee
<pb facs="tcp:11838:52"/>able to prooue that hee hath beene alwayes a great friende vnto the cleargie, and obſerued all the ceremonies of the Churche, to wit, that hee hath hearde Maſſe, beene confeſſed, and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the croſſe and Images: To bee ſhort, That hee hath done al cleane co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie to that that his accuſers haue depoſed, which muſt bee ordinarily done within niene dayes, and then his cauſe is merueilouſly well amended: howbeit all the excuſes that hee can make therein are to no purpoſe, except there come in no witneſſes againſt him, &amp; when the contrarie are examined by the Iudge, they conclude vpon the mattter, and the aduocate Fiſkall prayeth an inſtaunce that it may bee ended, as it pleaſeth hym. After this, certaine Fryers and Doctors of Diuinitie examine his beliefe, that is to ſay, they make an interpretation of whatſoeuer the priſoner hath ſpoken of faith, and if in theyr o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion hee hath ſaide well, hee is adiudged to be ſet free and at libertie, and yet notwithout his great domage, which hee ſhall both feele, and ſmell of againe, as followeth.</p>
            <p>When they can get nothing at all of him,
<note place="margin">A m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cruel ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination or tryall.</note> but that hee is able to excuſe hymſelfe, they then put hym to a ſhrewde trumpe or tryall: For firſt they bryng him through many odde doores of certaine caues vnder the ground, vnto a place where the Iudge ſitteth. And thither preſently commeth the hangman, appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled in a blacke linnen caſſocke much like vnto the garmente, which the Spaniardes weare vppon maundie Thurſday, when as for pennance ſake they beate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues vntil the blood trickle down withall. Theyr head and face is couered with an hood, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no more but <hi>2.</hi> holes in it, for to looke out at: In this ſort commeth in the hangman apparrelled, to terrifie the pryſoner, as if the Diuell himſelfe woulde correct him for his ſinnes: when this is done, the Iudge admoniſheth him to tell the truth, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſting that if through torture any leg or limme of his be broken, that the fault and ſcathe ſhall bee his, and lye in his owne necke. After this, the poore pryſoner is ſhaken out of all his clowtes, ſaue that they tye a lynnen ragge to couer his priuities. Anone after hee maketh the hangman a ſigne, what torment hee ſhall haue.</p>
            <p>Nowe the ordinary torment of the pryſoner is this: Firſt, his handes are bounde together behinde his backe, and his body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:11838:52"/>tryſed vp into the ayre with a tormentrous engine, they bind to his feete inſtruments of pron of twentie fiue pounds weight: then the Inquiſitors ſay vnto him: vnderſtand thou fellow, that if thou wilt not confeſſe the troth, aſſure thy ſelfe we will leaue thee heere to die in theſe torments: In this paine hangeth this wretched and miſerable patient, all his weeping and teares hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping him nothing at all. Then the hangman letteth him ſlip at one choppe almoſt to the ground, by meane whereof one ioynt falleth from another. When this is done, the hangman giueth him the ſecond and third charge, and then getteth hym vp: and thus this vnnaturall torture and horrible torment laſteth from niene of the clocke vntill it bee eleuen or twelue. When the pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner continueth conſtant and will confeſſe nothyng, hee is carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Churche, where the Barbour Surgeons put him to three tymes ſomuch paine. The patient beeing in this miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble eſtate, they will him to bee confeſſed or ſhriuen, whereupon they finde of what religion hee is: and if ſo bee that hee will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe himſelfe to the Prieſt, they haue a notarie hid behinde ſome clothes to write and note all the pryſoners confeſſion, becauſe hee maketh him to ſpeake diſtinctly and a loude. Then the Prieſt telleth him: That hee hath power &amp; aucthoritie to deliuer him out of the handes of the fathers Inquiſitors. By theſe and ſuch like words they ſometimes deceiue and beguile the poore pryſoners, for if they confeſſe any thing, they bring their owne teſtimonie againſt them, to render them puniſhable. Then the Inquiſitors giue it ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly out both abroad and in the priſon, that the pryſoner hath confeſſed enough, and beſides, hath accuſed and named all his companious and fellow brethren, although it bee nothyng ſo. Which thyng cauſeth the neighbours that haue hearde of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great croſſes of the patient, accuſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, before any body els hath accuſed them, becauſe they woulde be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to the fathers and Inquiſitors of the faith, thinking they ſhoulde bee out of all danger, when as they had once confeſſed their faults.</p>
            <p>The hurte and ſicke pryſoners are carried to an Hoſpitall, where the Surgeons and ſeruitours of the Hoſpital deale reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably with them, vntill ſuche time as they are carryed backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to pryſon. The Notarie, and Gailor or keeper of the
<pb facs="tcp:11838:53"/>pryſon, twiſe a moneth viſit the pryſoners, to ſee them haue ſuch neceſſaries as they want, and to finde fault with thoſe which ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther take away theyr victuals from them, or doe them any hurt.</p>
            <p>When the day of giuing ſentence, and of execution draweth neere: to wit, two dayes before, they ſende for the pryſoners, whome the Inquiſitors commaund to tell and ſhe we them of all theyr moueable and vnmoueable goods, willyng them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale nothing, to the end that they which are in their houſes bee not accuſed of theft, or that they themſelues by the iudgementes of God, fall not dead to the grounde, as <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphyra</hi> his wife did at the Apoſtles feete, becauſe they lyed and kept backe ſome of their goods.</p>
            <p>The night before the day appointed, they are ſhryuen, &amp; that day in the morning, the officers of the Inquiſition bryng vnto them Saint <hi>Bennets</hi> furniture of apparrel, which is a gally caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſocke without fleeues, much like vnto the Romanes clokes, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered with blacke linnen cloth. And vpon their heads they haue a Biſhops myter made of paper, vpon which is painted a man ſitting by the fire:
<note place="margin">The ſentence of heretikes.</note> and the man aforeſaide, hath his hands bound to his necke, who firſt is led about the flame, and afterwarde to the fire. When he is brought to the place of execution, the ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers goe ſinging before him, and as many as are condemned in any pecuniarie or bodily puniſhment: on eyther ſide of them, follow the Seriant of the Inquiſition: and beſides, two Fryars or Ieſuites to exhort and admoniſh the citizens: ouer &amp; beſides, there followe the ſworne officers, Iudges, Preſidents, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours, and Lieuetenants of the king for that Countrie, with many Noble men &amp; Gentlemen, being al aſſembled together in theyr pallaces.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, there are the Prieſts, and Chapiter of the cathedral Church, Abbots, and Pryors, and a great many moe, to ſhed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent blood. But the aduocate Fiſkal, and the Atturney ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall ryde alſo vnto the place of execution, hauing a banner of red damaſk carried before them, on the one ſide wherof is armes richly imbrodered, with the name of the Pope, who hath confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and eſtabliſhed the Inquiſitors, &amp; on the other ſide armes,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:11838:53"/>and the name of king <hi>Ferdinando,</hi> and on the toppe of the pole of the banner head, is a ſiluer croſſe gylt. There are alſo on horſebacke the fathers Inquiſitors of the faith, and their offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. After this ſo honorable a troupe, followe a great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of people, who come twentie mile of to this goodly feaſt, &amp; they goe all together vnto a great plaine, where two ſcaffoldes are ſet vp, the one for the accuſed, and the other for the fathers Inquiſitors: amongeſt whome, one of them maketh an oration in the prayſe and honour of the Inquiſition, and in the diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending and aboliſhyng of all hereſies. This oration beeing ended, one beginneth openly to pronounce the iudgements vpon the poore pacients, orderly one after another, beginning firſt with theſe that haue the moſt gracious &amp; eaſieſt kinde of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. After the publication of theſe ſentences, the chiefe and head Inquiſitor, ſingeth certaine collects, to wit, <hi>Oremus</hi> and <hi>Quaeſumus,</hi> for the conuertes, praying alſo vnto God y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it would pleaſe hym of his meere fauour and grace, to graunt them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feuerance in the Romiſh catholike faith vnto their liues ende. When hee hath thus ſaide, al the Cleargie ſing the Pſalme <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerere mei deus,</hi> which being ended, the Inquiſitor ſingeth cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine verſicles, whom the ſinging men anſwere in theyr muſical notes, crying, yelling, and bleating out like calues, as they are. Laſt of all, the ſaide Inquiſitor ſingeth the abſolution, whereby the penitents are abſolued of the errour of hereſie, but not of the puniſhment or paine, which is incontinently to be executed, with out fauour or mercy, yea contrary to all right and reaſon.</p>
            <p>After y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this abſolution is giuen, the Inquiſitors cauſe an oth to hee miniſtred to the people, to wit, that they ſhall liue and die in the faith, obedience, and religion of the Romiſh Church: and ſhall defend the ſame, and the Inquiſitors in all points, and againſt al men: hazarding theyr bodies againſt all ſuch as would do them any hurt or ſet vpon them. Ouer and beſides, that they ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce and abture whatſoeuer is contrary to the dectrine, and inſtitutions or ceremonies of the Romiſh church: Moreouer, that they ſhall withall their power and might, defend the holy office, and all their officers, miniſters, or ſeruants therof: taking both one and other to witnes, for the ſafetie &amp; aſſurance of the matter.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:11838:54"/>
            <p>And if therebe amongeſt theſe penitents or conuertes, any Cleargie man,
<note place="margin">The degrading of prieſtes.</note> bee hee religious man or Prieſt, that is founde to haue deſerued leſſe puniſhment then death, that man is degraded onely by wordes. This degradation is done by the Biſhoppe clad in all his <hi>pontificalibus,</hi> and by none other, by which hee is interdited from the adminiſtration of his office, benifice, and Prieſtly dignitie, vntill ſuch time as the Pope ſhall haue abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, enhabiled againe, or reſtored hym to his dignitie. But yf the fathers Inquiſitors haue condemned and iudged him to death, then the patient is degraded in very deede the ſelfe ſame day, as followeth: Firſt, hee is apparrelled in all his Churchrobes, as if hee ſhould go to maſſe. All which are taken from him by one that playeth the Biſhops part, vſing certaine ceremonies and wordes, as hee bereaueth him of them, one after another, vtterly cleane contrary to the ceremonies and wordes that are vſed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hym, when he is Prieſted. After this, they ſcrape his hands, lippes and crowne, with a glaſſe or raſor, to take away the holie oyle wherewith he was annoynted. All theſe ceremonies are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly vſed in the ſight of the whole world.</p>
            <p>Nowe, when all the ſentences are pronounced, &amp; the prieſtes degraded as aforeſaid, The ſeculer magiſtrate receiueth them, that muſt dye, accordyng to the appointment and commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my maſters the Inquiſitors, to execute and diſpatch them out of the worlde at the ordinarie place, hauing with them ſuche diueliſh and ſhameleſſe Proctours, as neuer ceaſe callyng vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to renounce the truth which they had confeſſed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued.</p>
            <p>But if the Inquiſitors vnderſtande that there are ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that haue not truly repented, but that the woolfe is couered w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſheepes ſkinne, they deliuer them into the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall magiſtrates hands, they beſeech him to deale fauourably with them, and to beware that they breake none of theyr lymmes, nor yet drawe any blood of them: and in theyr chiefe giuing of iudgement, they ſay: ſeeing that the paine and trauell which wee haue taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to conuert theſe perſons is all in vaine and to no purpoſe, wee deliuer them into the handes of the temporall magiſtrate, to bee puniſhed according to lawe and iuſtice: yet beeſeeching him that if ſo bee they ſhall acknowledge their errours and bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted,

            <p>And all the reſt which are not adiudged to dye, are ſent backe agayne to priſon, but the next daye in the morning, they that are condemned to be whipt, are ſcourged rounde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſtreetes: ſome are condemned to the Gallies, other ſome to perpetual impriſonment, and ſome of the reſt to weare S. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets</hi> furniture and carry him about.

            <p>Thou haſt now (gentle Reader) heard the cauſes &amp; occaſions of the Spaniards warring in the low countries, &amp; of their warring heretofore againſt the Mores in Spayne, by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou maiſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d from whence the very right ſpring head of theſe dolorous waters come, wherwith they had ouerflowed &amp; drowned the low cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries had not God of his meere mercy prouided for the ſame.

            <p>The king of Spayne fearing that the Proteſtantes Religion woulde encreaſe and grow in the low Countreyes, to the great hurt and diſaduauntage of the Catholike church, and loſſe of the Inquiſition, ſent very earneſtly (as hath beene heretofore in the firſt booke ſet downe) vnto his ſiſter the Lady Margaret Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſſe of Parma, willyng her to preuent this Empayre &amp; down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall.

            <p>Whiſes the Prince of Orange had authority and Gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he from the firſt beginning of the troubles and diſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, was very painefull and diligent, to appeaſe and pacifie all the troubles that were in the Countrey of <hi>Brabant:</hi> and I will leaue vnto the Reader to weigh and conſider of the eſtate wherein the ſayde Countrey of <hi>Brabant</hi> ſtoode, both before and after the troubles of the lowe Countries: and firſte tell of the notable warres that the Emperour Charles the fifte of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous memorie, and after him, king Phillip of Spayne beeyng Lordes of the lowe Countreyes, made, as it were for the ſpace of tenne yeeres with the Frenche king: and what effuſion of bloud happened in Fraunce, the ouerthrowe of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandes of menne may ſufficiently teſtifie: and the Princes and Frenche noblemen, and other nations, whiche aſſiſted king Henrie, who beſtowed both their bodies and goodes in his ſeruice. As alſo maye the ruined and deſtroyed Townes, Fortreſſes, Caſtles and others, or if they were well garniſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned yet they were fayne to ſhake off, their obedience from their naturall Lorde, and ſweare newe obedience to a newe Lorde, others that were vtterly ruined and deſtroyed, were brought and reduced into villages, and the Citizens, and all the reſt of the Inhabitants were ſacked and brought to ſuch pouerty as that they were all the daies of their life very poore and miſerable. Theſe are the fruits of curſed warre, which (alas) continued o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer long.</p>
            <p>But as by the ſuppreſſing of the warres in <hi>Brabant</hi> and the Countries neere adioyning, the people beganne to proſper, and the Countrey flooriſh: the people of the lowe countries were grieuouſly charged &amp; vexed with the Spaniſh Inquiſition, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che daily augmented, by reaſon of the increaſing of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reformed religion: inſomuch that it was great wonder, how the ſaide In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitiou was ſo long borne withall: And yet it is moſt manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowen y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſubiects of the ſaid low countries were alwaies ready not only to yeeld all their duetifull obedience, but alſo hazard their liues and goods in his Ma. ſeruice. On the other ſide, the Nobility both did and ſhewed, all their duetye, fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and louing affection: and as for the Eſtates, they richely gaue for the maintenaunce of the Warre a maruellous
<pb facs="tcp:11838:60"/>ſumme of money, and that ſo with good heartes, as that it was impoſſible for any man to imagine anye ſigne or token of miſly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in them: ſo that it is moſt like to be true, that the ſayd lowe Countries haue ſo loued his Maieſty, as that they behaued them ſelues as faithfull ſubiectes in all thinges which touched the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyence, and reuerence due to him, to the ende that his lowe Countries might alwayes be aſſured againſt all forren inuaſion and warre.</p>
            <p>Seeyng then that the ſubiectes, eſpecially the nobility, ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bediently and ſeruiceably ſtood vnto his Maieſty, and in the end gouerned the warres which continued ſo long, the ſubiects had a woonderful great hope, that his Maieſty would procure, that the ſayd low countries ſhould be franke and free from the daunger of ciuill warres. And, ſo long as the ſubiects ſaw al things goe well forward, they alwayes continued conſtaunt in their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and fidelity: and although the Brabanders, who heereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore flouriſhed in all kynde of trade of merchandiſe, had in the former warres beene in great perill and daunger, yet for all that they gathered a greate peece of money: ſo that it is too too manifeſt, that the king was well aſſured agaynſt all the force of any Monarches and Princes: and that which is more, beyng reconcyled with his enemies, he was not onelye diſcharged of all the debtes whiche grewe by reaſon of the warres, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in a very fewe yeeres, attayned to woonderful great wealth, proſperity and honour. For, when his Maieſty was rayſed vy to ſo high a degree of honour, forren Potentates &amp; Princes feared him, becauſe his ſubiectes ſo honoured and reuerenced him: and his Maieſty was thought to be the moſt mighty Monarch, yea ſo farre paſſing al others, as that it muſt of neceſſity needes bee granted, that whatſoeuer they were that would goe about to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach and diſturbe, this his ſo great good felicity, muſt vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly by this notable vuyon, be oppreſſed and beate downe: Iuſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that all they haue greatly offended, whiche haue buſied themſelues about matters, preiudiciall or hurtfull to his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, and the common weale, and done ſuch thinges as are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the example of others, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the warres being ſuppreſſed, they haue renewed freſh co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>motions, and cauſed ciuill warres: and therfore the Prince of Orange doth verily and ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:11838:60"/>beleeue, that they which haue brought the countrey of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant</hi> into this extreme miſery, calamity, &amp; bondage, ought like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to be puniſhed and chaſtiſed.</p>
            <p>And ſith the Prince of Orange is publikely in the Indit e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, accuſed by the Attorney generall, to be the original &amp; firſt mouer of the alterations happened in <hi>Brabant,</hi> he is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ten ted to abyde the paynes in the ſaid Inditement expreſſed, if ſo be it bee true that the Attorney hath ſet downe. The ſayde Attorney ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall affirmeth, that the Prince is ambitious, and of an vnbry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deled mynde to gouerne, whereuppon enſueth, that hee hath a purpoſe to take vppon him, and enioy an other mans office and Eſtate, and hath pretended nothing els in al his counſels and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres.</p>
            <p>For the confutation of this article, as the originall and chiefe poynt of the complaynt of the Attorney generall, it is ſufficient that he referre the matter ouer vnto all ſuch as know the prince of Orange, by whom it may be vnderſtoode, if euer hee was deſirous of rule: and beſides, that he hath well gouerned his goodes and poſſeſſions, whiche by Gods grace were lefte and geuen vnto him, by whiche hee hath more increaſed his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and reputation, then by any other charge that euer he had. And al men know, that if the Prince had ſought and hunted after his owne particular gayne, that hee had a farre better waye and meane to haue heaped riches together, by which hee might haue come to eſtimation and authority, &amp; there held him, then to be at great charge and expenſes in Court, in hope to come to autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity by others procurement: ſo that all the world knoweth, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince in all his actions and behauiour neuer ſought his owne particuler benefite.</p>
            <p>And beſides, the Prince neuer once thought to drawe awaye his Ma. ſubiects from their obedience due vnto the ſame, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that the people alwayes moſt earneſtly loued him, but contrariwiſe continually to keepe them in a good liking of his Ma. but the very cauſe, in truth, of this their eſtraunging them, is the cruelty of the commiſſions newly publiſhed. This then is the onelie waye and meane, that maye bee ſaide, that the Prince euen to the laſt caſt, hath alwayes ſhewed his good and ſincere affection vnto his Maieſty &amp; his lowe Countries:
<pb facs="tcp:11838:61"/>and it muſt of neceſſitie be graunted, that the Prince at no hand hath at any time, ment to take vpon himſelfe any authoritie ouer his Maieſtie: which as ſome thought, might more commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly haue been conſerued in tranquilitie and peace: whereupon followeth, that the Prince his meaning was farre otherwiſe. For, his Maieſties authoritie coulde no way haue been peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conſerued, if ſo be the Countrey of Brabant ſhould hane been conſerued in her auncient and former proſperitie, but by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to the exerciſe of the cruell Inquiſition. For he ment to oppoſe him ſelfe agaynſt the ſayde Inquiſition: All which his actions doe witneſſe, that he is no whit ambitious, but cleane contrary. For, long before that time, hee had reſigned his digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Counſell of Eſtate, as alſo the dignitie of the kinges chiefe officer of the treaſure that aroſe vppon penall Statutes, which is the meeteſt office of all other to binde the Eſtates to be beholden vnto him: Yea hee was offered to take vppon him the gouernmente of altogether, if hee woulde haue accepted of it, whereunto, all the reſt of the nobilitie laboured moſt carefully to attayne: But the Prince ſo abhorred this Ambition, as that hee reſigned theſe two dignities into his Maieſties handes, when he conſidered that hee coulde doe his Maieſtie but ſlender ſeruice in counſell, by reaſon of certaine beaſtly dealings which bereaued him of the meane for that ſeruice.</p>
            <p>Neuertheleſſe, when his Maieſtie had appointed him to be of his Counſell, hee ſo duetifully adminiſtzed this function and dignitte, as his conſcience witneſſed vnto him to be neceſſarie, to each mans moſt profitte, although he afterwarde perceiued that his Maieſties loue altered and abated, through the practiſe and deuiſe of one or two noble men.</p>
            <p>But after that his Maieſtie had aduiſedly euery way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered of the Prince of Oranges good and faithful ſeruice, as he departed out of Zeland towards Spaine, hee moſt earneſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought the ſaid P. to be of his counſell, who after long excuſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted thereof. Nowe, when as the Prince ſaw, that they helde on their olde courſe, and far otherwiſe then his M. had comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and appointed him, two yeeres after or neere there about, he agayne beſought that he might be diſcharged. Wherefore the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e we deuiſes were more and more ſet forwarde, which were the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:11838:61"/>cauſes of the beginning of the troubles and commotions: By which the Inquiſition was ſomewhat moderated and a freſh ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſſed: But as in theſe Countries the Regiment of Aimaines, as a neceſſary thing, was brought into them for their defence and ſafegarde, they were ſuffered to haue Sermons as well in the Townes as in the fieldes abroade: and namely in diuers places, ſome (except where the reformed religion had been alreadie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of in the Countreys neere there about) kept the exerciſe of the ſayde religion ſecretly: whereby, the ſayde reformed reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion dayly encreaſed in this ſo populous Countrey, ſo that at the laſt in fewe yeeres, the name of the Inquiſition became very odious, conſidering that by it aboue fifcie thouſande had been put to death in Europe, and a greater number were enforced to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake their goodes, kinſfolkes, and all their friendes, and ſpende their liues in perpetuall miſerie: which thinges did not onelye cauſe great alterations and changes, but an hatred againſt the inquiſition: Inſomuch that in many places, the officers durſt not openly put it in execution, but very ſecretly, and yet not without great perill and danger of commotion. Which thing ſome of the officers can beare witneſſe of, who had ſome of the priſonners taken from them agaynſt their willes: whiche cauſed all ſuche as experience had taught, long before to foreſee, that the ſayde Inquiſition woulde bee the cauſe of ſome trouble and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if in continuaunce of time it were not wiſely prouided for, and good order taken about it.</p>
            <p>The Queene of Hongrie then gouerneſſe of the low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, greatly feared this miſchiefe and miſerie. Wherefore ſhee tooke her voyage to Auſbourgh towardes her brother the Emperour of famous memorie Charles the fifth, with whome ſhee ſo handled her buſineſſe, as that the crueltie of the Counſell of Trent, then concluded vpon, ſhoulde be moderated, and that the Antwerpians and Brabanders that woulde not receyue the Inquiſition, ſhoulde bee quite and cleane rid of it, as afterward they were.</p>
            <p>Nowe, whiles the Countrey of Brabante had beene in qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et a good long time, throughe the aucthoritie of the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and that all thinges were ordered by the aduiſe of the
<pb facs="tcp:11838:62"/>Counſell of eſtate, the Attorney Generall thruſt himſelfe in to treate or deale immediatly after his Ma. departure, eyther alone or els with ſome tyrannous noblemen, of &amp; in matters of great charge and waight, and immediately ſignified vnto his Ma. of their peruerſe counſel. When the king was aduertiſed that the Inquiſition had not his right courſe and proceeding, he was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry angry &amp; penſiue: neuertheleſſe ſome curteous noblemen ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly beſought him, to haue an hearty remembrance, of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices &amp; good deedes which his ſubiectes had done in the former warres: &amp; ſo rule himſelf as the ſtate of the time required, &amp; abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhe all newe deuiſes, as the new Biſhoppes &amp; the Inquiſition, according to the priuiledges of the countries: ſeeing that ſome wicked men had practized theſe new deuiſes in the lowe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, contrary to the ſtate of the time, and againſt all the immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities and priuiledges of the lowe Countries: and that thoſe thinges might be aboliſhed, conſidering that the troubles and commotion in Fraunce which happened there, by reaſon of the Inquiſition, are appeaſed and ſuppreſſed by the ceaſing therof. Moreouer, that the erection and inſtitution of the new Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rickes, is hurtfull to the forraine Archbiſhoppes and biſhoppes, whiche haue any iuriſdiction and dioceſſe in theſe low countries. For this and many other reaſons therefore, they of the lowe Countries conſidering, that the newe deuiſes were the cauſes of great miſery and manye miſchiefes, if in tyme they were not prouided for and remedyed, made complaynt vnto the Gouerneſſe: who, by, and vppon, the deliberation and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Counſell of eſtate diſpatched the Baron of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigni</hi> knight of the order, and ſent him poſte into Spayne to his Maieſty, with commiſſion to declare vnto the king the Eſtate, and generall miſlyking of the lowe countries, whiche hath riſen by reaſon of theſe newe deuiſes: and that for this cauſe it is come to paſſe, that the Nobilitye of <hi>Brabant</hi> to meete with this miſchiefe and miſery, haue beene preſſed and conſtrayned, eſpecially to haue theyr deſire and demaunde accompliſhed, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes hoping, that his Maieſty would ſatiſfie their requeſt, or that he would at the leaſt moderate the charge and burden wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they were too too much oppreſſed, and eſpecially the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes and Abbots whiche heretofore flouriſhed in <hi>Brabant,</hi>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:11838:62"/>were nowe greatly endammaged: wherfore they haue likewiſe ſent their Deputies vnto his Ma. as alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Antwerpians, for the withſtanding and letting of the Inquiſition, and the Inſtitution of the new Biſhops. The which meſſage at ſometimes had kept in ſuſpence the troubles of the low countries, becauſe euerye man hoped, that the ſayde Deputies, and Ambaſſades, might by his Maieſties good counſell and concluſion, receiue ſome good ordinance for their aduancement and profite, accordingly as the affayres required. But that the reformed Religion was ſo roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted euery where, as that in ſome places Sermons were open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preached, to wit, at <hi>Valence, Tournay,</hi> and other Cities and Townes: &amp; the reaſon was, that becauſe the liberty of the religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in France was agreed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the low countrey me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hoped, &amp; verily thought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to haue as wel deſerued for their ſeruices paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, towards their king, &amp; his preſide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Frenchme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> towards the French king, and therefore that they ought likewiſe to bee agreed, &amp; haue the liberty of conſcience granced of them.</p>
            <p>For it might be manifeſtly ſeene, that it was impoſſible for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> auncient Romiſh ordinances to be obſerued and kept in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries aforeſaid, becauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they which vſed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trade of mercha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>diſe, bought &amp; ſolde their commodities with ſuch nations their neere neighbours, as were of another religion. But when the aduerſe party began to ſuppreſſe &amp; root out the reformed religion, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it might be eaſily ſeene, how it continually grew &amp; encreaſed. And yet neuertheles the cardinal of <hi>Granuelle</hi> ſo hotly followed his buſines, as that he put the afore ſayd Biſhops in poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe be himſelfe had the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Malines</hi> for his ſhare, by vertue wherof he was <hi>Legatus natus,</hi> &amp; Primate ouer al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other biſhops, &amp; had ouer &amp; beſides for a commendum, the Abbotſhip of <hi>Affligam,</hi> which was one of the richeſt in al the whole countrey: hauing gotten alſo to himſelfe of the Abbayes that remayned certayne of the Diuines to be his fauourites.</p>
            <p>And although co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to al hope &amp; expectation, this new deuiſe was brought in into diuers cities, yet might the enuy &amp; malice of many be eaſily ſeene &amp; knowen herein: for, diuers cities woulde at no ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d receiue &amp; accept of theſe new biſhops, but oppoſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues againſt them: to wit, the <hi>Antwerpians, Rurmondians, Goreningians, Deuentrians,</hi> &amp; others, Howbeit, by this doing,
<pb facs="tcp:11838:63"/>the cardinal of <hi>Gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uelle</hi> had obteined ſuch authority &amp; fauor, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might giue away &amp; beſtow al his M. offices &amp; benefices wher it pleaſed him, inſomuch y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for his part to be Lord &amp; king ouer al his other fellow biſhops: for by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mean diuers deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were practized, to obtaine &amp; keepe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> authority &amp; ſuperinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentſhip in his Ma. countries. And to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end he might vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the ſtate of al the whole doings there: as alſo to get the loue and good wil of al the kings, princes, &amp; pote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tates neere about, he had authority to make &amp; place al his Ma. commiſſaries &amp; other offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers: &amp; emo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt the reſt made his brother Germaine Ambaſſador in France, who had woon there ſuch fauour as that the king and the Queene ſent with al careful diligence, to haue him ſent back vnto their Ma. for the quiet of the common weale.</p>
            <p>And whoſoeuer would co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider &amp; throughly weigh y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> things afore ſaid, might eaſily iudge who it was, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> had vſurped, &amp; chale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged to himſelf power &amp; authority aboue his Ma. fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce haue procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded al theſe troubles &amp; grifes. But al theſe things, &amp; new deuiſes aforeſaid, bread ſuch great ſorow &amp; heauines in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> P. of Oranges heart, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he deſired not once nortwiſe, but many and ſundry times, to be diſcharged of his Counſellerſhip of eſtate, &amp; of the Lord Treaſorerſhip of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reuenewe of his highnes forfaitures of penall lawes, deſiring nothing ſo much as to haue theſe new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſes aboliſhed. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaid Prince co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered &amp; vnderſtood, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſought by al meanes poſſible, vtterly to bring in ſubiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey of Braba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> end he might be no occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>ſtand and gainſay y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame, he carefully ſtood vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it to be diſcharged of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaid offices &amp; dignities, ſeeing it was neither hurtful, either to his M. or yet to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> weale, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end he might be at a more leyſure to look to his own buſines, &amp; not be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d guilty of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diſorders w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> he foreſaw was like to come through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtrage &amp; new deuiſe. And for this cauſe he beſought both his Ma. &amp; alſo the Ducheſſe of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mathen Lady Regent to be diſcharged of his eſtate &amp; gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; ſith y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>federates had exhibited their ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wherof y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aduerſaries talked diuerſly their pleaſures. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if the Prince had been ſo ambitious, as to haue taken to him ſelfe his Ma. authority, it is moſt likely, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his highnes wold haue diſcharged him, &amp; not expreſſely commanded him to continue in his Eſtate: for it is a moſte iuſt law to diſcharge ambitious no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their eſtates: leaſt in the end they wold go about to take
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:11838:63"/>vpon them the poſſeſſion of all the kinges countries, &amp; make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theyr owne. And therefore this is cleane contrary to that that the Atturney generall hath ſet downe: for it is before ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared, that the prince neither before nor yet after his high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe departure, was ſuſpected to bee ambitious, or meant to take vpon him his maieſties autoritie, either yet make himſelf Lord of Braba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, ſeeing it is moſt euident y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the prince ſought by al poſſible meanes to bee vnburdened of his Eſtate. For all men may well vnderſtand, that will at leaſt conſider any thing of the matter, that ſithence his maieſties departure, the cardinall of <hi>Granuell</hi> hath had all power and authoritie: and therefore it may truely both by many teſtemonies and examples bee verified, that I had great reaſon to ſeeke to bee diſcharged of mine eſtate &amp; dignitie: howbeit I cannot forget to ſpeake one thing, which is this, that the dutches of <hi>Parma</hi> hath confeſſed, that ſithence the departure of the ſaid Cardinall, that ſhe within a few monethes vnderſtood more of the ſtate and affayres of Brabant then ſhe did in all the tyme that the Cardinall continued there.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, when as in the laſt troubles at <hi>Bruxelles,</hi> the dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes was purpoſed to flie vnto <hi>mons</hi> in <hi>Haynault,</hi> and from thence towards the <hi>Alpes,</hi> to giue place vnto ſuche as deſired to haue greater authoritie then ſhe had: The Prince in the company of other noble men inſtantly beſought her, not to work ſuch iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to her ſelfe, nor ſhame to his maieſtie: whereupon euidently &amp; truly appeareth, that all the Princes actions and purpoſes are far from all ambition: for if the prince woulde haue taken vppon him the whole gouernment, he could neuer haue had a better &amp; fitter occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue brought it to paſſe, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dutches departure: howbeit he was of another mind, &amp; therefore vſed all the meanes poſſible he could to ſtay her going, &amp; preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diſorderly dealing.</p>
            <p>And deſides, when councell was giuen to his maieſtie, that it would be very profitable for his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel of Eſtate to be increaſed with noble men and wealthie learned men, for the preuenting of all diſſention &amp; diſcord, &amp; that all things might be better admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred: and chiefly becauſe that the ordenances of the councell aforeſaide might be obſerued, &amp; diligently executed, &amp; to be ſhort, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all occaſions might be cut off from euery one for the mouing of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſies, according to euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sfa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tafie, or els to

            <p>And further he required &amp; ſaid that he was minded to get him home to his owne houſe, &amp; leaue his roome to ſome other, as the Dutches and diuers els of the councel of eſtate, had thereof ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred good teſtimonie. It is therefore not neceſſary to lay open more certaine &amp; apparant occaſions of theſe troubles: namely, when a man weigheth &amp; conſidereth how deſirous the <hi>Braba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders</hi> are moſt earneſtly to defend their priuileges, which they ſo long <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>yme haue mioyed by vertue of the mutuall contracts made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt their Dukes and them, and alſo to maintaine their priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges which they haue obtained partly by thoſe Dukes, &amp; partly by the Emperours of old time graunted vnto them: eſpecially when they feared to haue been bereaued of them through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great oppreſſion and burden of ſtrange people. But as the Cardinal of <hi>Granuell</hi> perſiſted &amp; continued in his imagination and opinion: and that in his abſence his adherents and complices proceeded on further in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter, foorthwith all diſcord &amp; diffention began to reuiue, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it could not be met withal, by reaſon of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diſſention y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was betwene thoſe of the councell of eſtate, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> priuie councel, &amp; the treaſurers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> receipt of the reuenewes of the forfaitures of penall lawes, who were ſo ouer ruled by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cardinal, &amp; the Lords that tooke his part, as that they could neuer agree together.</p>
            <p>And becauſe that this and many other ſuch like thinges bred and nouriſhed great diſſention, wherfore to the end to meet w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all appara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t diſorders &amp; miſchiefes, it was determined that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Count
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:11838:64"/>of <hi>Egmont</hi> ſhould bee ſent vnto his Maieſtie, at whoſe returne euery man comforted himſelfe with good hope, and an expreſſe declaration of amendment, and remedie of euery thing, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for the moderation of the Inquiſition. And for the ſame purpoſe in the yeere 1565. there aſſembled three Biſhops, three Diuines, three Doctors of the ciuill lawe, and as many Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtes, to conclude a moderation vpon the ſaide Inquiſition: whereupon in the ende it was ſent to his maieſtie, howbeit no whit agreed vnto, neither yet publiſhed. Ouer and beſides this, in the end of the ſame yeere his maieſtie gaue expreſſe comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, that the new biſhops ſhould bee brought in without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, or els proclaime the decrees of the councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> &amp; giue vnto the Inquiſitors their authoritie and power, by which they had both te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poral &amp; eccleſiaſtical knowledge &amp; authoritie, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the determination &amp; coucluſion of the <hi>Tridentine</hi> councel ſhold foorthwith be put in execution with all ſeueritie.</p>
            <p>The copies of this commandement were by and by ſent vnto al the cities &amp; townes of the low countries, expreſly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manding them to rule the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues according to his maieſties commadement and commiſſions. This was the ſecond cauſe and chief occaſion of the alterations and diſorders as hereafter ſhalbe ſhewed.</p>
            <p>Seeing then that the inquiſition principally, was by his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie expreſly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded, it muſt of neceſſitie follow, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al the fault of the troubles and diſorders paſſed, is to be laid vpon himſelfe &amp; vpon none els. Wherfore it neither agreeth with the truth, nor yet any way like to be true, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> through the exhortation of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince of <hi>Orange</hi> the ſubiects ſhould rebel againſt his hignes, or that he firſt of all ſhould by his perſwaſions draw them out of the way, &amp; ſtir vp the greateſt part of the nobilitie to confederate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues with him, or to be mutinous, and by an oth confirm their league, to the end to oppoſe &amp; defend themſelues at all times againſt his maieſtie &amp; his ordinances, which were from the firſt beginning obſerued &amp; kept. And beſides, it is vnlike to be true, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bly and confederacie was made in his courts of <hi>Breda</hi> &amp; <hi>Bruxelles,</hi> &amp; ſo accordingly to be the authour, fautor &amp; chiefe of the obſtinate &amp; mutinous rebels, or diſturber of the publike weale. For, he neuer ſtirred vp ſedition or diſſention againſt his maieſtie, &amp; therefore ought not to be accuſed thereof: for the ſaide conſpiracie began
<pb facs="tcp:11838:65"/>not by any exhorting of his, but through the griefes proceeding from the Inquiſition, and becauſe that the promiſes and other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents made in the yeere, 50.55.62.65. as before hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared and ſhewed, were not performed and kept. Wherefore the prince of <hi>Orange</hi> affirmeth that by the foreſaide league, and the accuſations, and other matters enſuing, the ſelfe ſame thing came to paſſe which the Dutches of <hi>Parma</hi> heeretofore had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in open councell: to wit, that the declaration of the cruell commiſſions publiſhed by his mateſtie, woulde cauſe a meruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous alteration, ſeeing that many had conceiued ſom good hope, of the good tidings that the Count of <hi>Egmont</hi> would bring with him at his returne out of Spaine.</p>
            <p>And it is ſithence alſo come to paſſe, that it was written to the Dutches, as ſhe herſelfe hath confeſſed in her anſwere, that the declaration of the Commiſſions publiſhed by his maieſtie, was the cauſe of the whole alteration: which commiſſions (as before is ſaid) are the very ſpring head of the league, made againſt his knowledge and will. But ſo ſoone as the ſame declaration was come to the handes of the ſaid Dutches, and vnderſtood the content thereof, 15. dayes before the confederates had aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled themſelues at the Towne houſe: ſhe ſaide and expreſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that the ſame declaration liked her not in al thoſe points, &amp; that ſhe could not deuiſe howe the rigour of the commiſſions coulde by any meanes keepe the lowe countries in peace and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie. Surely, her highnes tooke not the meaning of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſederates to bee ſedicious: ſeeing ſhee vertly beleeued that the confederates woulde attempt nothing againſt his maieſtie, nor their countrie, neither yet any thing that might be hurtful there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: ſo that this is a cleere caſe, that theſe alterations &amp; troubles came firſt and principally from the Inquiſition. Here are to be conſidered and weighed the examples of Germanie, Fraunce, England, and Scotland: ho wheit it muſt needes bee graunted, that his maieſtie meant to ſhewe nothing els by the ſetting forth of theſe cruell commiſſions, but in time vtterly to deſtroy y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie of Brabant. And contrariwiſe, in the countries where the religion, or at leaſt the libertie of conſcience is graunted and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed vpon, &amp; where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Inquiſition hath had nothing to do, there is a peaceable and quiet abiding and dwellyng. Which thing
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:11838:65"/>witneſſeth vnto vs, that there is a greater difference to liue w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of conſcience without the Inquiſition, then in all malice, iniquitie, and licenciouſnes, without correction and chaſtifeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: neyther yet did it euer like y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> princes &amp; potentates of Germanie, who euer deſired the peace of theyr countries, &amp; alwayes ſought the publyque weale of them, vnto whome the matter as greatly apperteineth as vnto his maieſtie, but to ſuffer the libertie of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion or conſcience, if at any time they feared commotions and rebellion.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, his maieſtie might well enough vnderſtande the meaning of the confederates, ſeeyng they neuer ſhewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues obſtinate, or went about by force, to obteine y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which they craued: but only beſought his mateſtie to vnderſt and their grief and ſupplication, &amp; thereupon take the aduiſe of the generall E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, promiſing hereafter to liue in the cauſe of religion, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ordenauce &amp; determination of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaid Eſtates. And the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if any man ſhould be diſobedient, ſeditious, or a diſturber of the common weale, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might be puniſhed according to the qualitie of the offence. Now the confederates deſire nothing els, but to haue their ſupplicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heard, or that the generall Eſtates might be called &amp; aſſembled together: and ſeeing that this buſines had ſo fallen out in Brabant, that is, was alſo neceſſary that a thing of ſo great importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ſhould be propounded to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaid eſtates, who in all ages, vpon ſuch occaſions according to the tenure of theyr priuileges, were called together by the Emperour Charles the fift: to determine &amp; conclude vpon the ſtate of religion according to the ordenances, which cleerely may be ſeen in the text graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and publiſhed in the yeere of our Lord. 1531.</p>
            <p>Wherefore the confederates thought it lawefull for them to requyre and craue ſo much, ſith it hath been alwayes the cuſtome in ſuch ſort to require ſuch kind of things. As alſo in the bookes of the Machabees, we ſhall finde good and holy confederacies made, for the aduauncing of the glory of God, the welfare and health of the Gouernors and Magiſtrates, and the proſperity of the common wealth &amp; of the countrie. Likewiſe the prince of Ora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge thinketh, that the confederacie of the nobilitie ought not to be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for ſedition or rebellion againſt his maieſty, forſomuch as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>federates haue toyntly promiſed to ay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb facs="tcp:11838:66"/>and aſſiſt one the other againſt the ſame: but yet vpon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that this conſpiracie, as before is ſayd, ſhould end, when as his maieſtie had by experience found, that the Inquiſition wold be enemie to all peace &amp; tranquilitie: wherefore they alſo offred to deſiſt &amp; leaue off theyr petition &amp; purpoſe, &amp; yeelde vnto his maieſtie alobedience &amp; be ruled by the determination &amp; ordena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the generall eſtates.</p>
            <p>The dutches alſo was of this minde, who had ſaid, before the arriuall of the confederates, that ſhe was of the opinion to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate his maieſties determination as touching the Inquiſition: yea ſhe made a kynd of ſhewe in the kyngs name, that ſhe would exempt the countrie of <hi>Brabant</hi> from the Inquiſition: howbeit ſithence her firſt commyng into theſe low countries, vntill her departure hence, ſhe hath in very deed ſhewed the contrary. For ſhee tooke this confederacy, and the exhibityng of the ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for diſobedtence and ſedition, although ſhee had notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding heretofore diſſembled the ſame both in word and deed. This her diſſembling and hypocriſie the prince minded to ſhew, not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee had beene the inuenter and furtherer of this confederacie, which no way toucheth him, but becauſe he woulde hereeby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that ſhe iumped with his maieſties opinion, who eſteemed of the confederates as rebels &amp; traytours.</p>
            <p>But when as the dutches by his maieſties commandement &amp; by the aduiſe of all the councels, had agreed to the ſupplication of the confederates, yea, ſo far as that ſhe had promiſed vnder her owne hand and ſeale, that the confederates ſhould not bee holden guiltie, nor yet accuſed by reaſon of this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>federacie, nor of what ſoeuer followed thereon, it followeth that neither his maieſtie, nor yet the dutches, had iuſt occaſion to diſtruſt the confederates: neyther ſay that the Dutches had done it for any other purpoſe, &amp; to appeaſe thoſe that had vndutifully behaued themſelues, and caſt downe the Images, which was altogether done againſt his will and pleaſure. Neuertheleſſe, a man might ſay, that his maieſties meaning and the Dutches were diuerſe, although they agreed and were all one. For the intent of eyther of both was none other, but to winne the friendſhip and good will of the confederates, whereby the welfare of his maieſtie (as they thoughte) ſhoulde bee more aduaunced then hyndred.</p>
            <pb n="61" facs="tcp:11838:66"/>
            <p>For the declaration of his Maieſtie, and of the Dutcheſſe, hath been ſo at large ſet downe, as that it is enough to excuſe and purge them of the accuſation wherewith they were charged: wherefore it is to be conſidered, that neyther his Maieſtie, nor yet the Dutcheſſe, do take the confederates to bee ſeditious, thus a man may eaſily weigh, how variable and inconſtant the hearts and thoughtes of Kings and Princes are.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, the king had written with his owne hande to the ſame intent and purpoſe in the moneth of Auguſt, to wit, after and before that the ſayd confederacie and ſupplication were made, that his Maieſtie greatly liked of the prince of Oranges ſeruices, neyther did hee make any account of that that had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: and that the Prince ſhoulde not leaue off for any other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to bee perſwaded, touching his fidelitie, but that his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie wholly truſted him, and woulde not beleeue any reaſons that ſhoulde tende to his hurt, of whome hee wrote, that they had been too blame, and done very ill.</p>
            <p>Thus by the reaſons aboue ſayde may eaſily bee perceiued, that there is no likelihoode, why the ſayde Prince ſhoulde bee called the chiefe, inuentor, and fautor of thoſe that were rebelles, ſeeing it could not be founde, that he had ſtirred vp, maynteyned, and defended the ſayde confederates, neither was any man able to ſay that euer he protected any of the confederats or others: and therfore why ſhould he be ther of accuſed? furthermore, he is char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſome of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> confederates put the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues in armes and ſtood at defenſe in diuers places, without regarde of any thing what ſo euer: which matter toucheth no whitte the ſayde Prince, and therefore not bounde to anſwere it, neyther yet to excuſe himſelf for other mens faultes and offences: and agayne hee is not to be charged in that, that ſome of the confederates became after Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belles and Traytors: ſeeing that what ſo euer enſued thereof, was done not onely without his commaundement, but alſo to his great ſorrowe and griefe.</p>
            <p>Yea and that which is more, all theſe thinges were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in his abſence, and for that cauſe, leuied hee men of warre for his owne defence, although his aduerſaries ſay to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: and that this was done, by reaſon that hee woulde take al his Maieſties authoritie to him ſelfe, conſidering that he had at that tyme in his handes both cities and caſtles.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:11838:67"/>
            <p>Howebeit the Prince had none other meaning, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Dutcheſſe commaundement, reduce the ſayde Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, eſpecially Holland, Zeland, and Vtryght, of which he was goueruour, to peace and quierneſſe, and them to conſerue vnder his Maieſties obedience and fidelitie: doing all duetie for the ſaythfull adminiſtring of his Eſtate and office. Whereof the preſidentes, Counſelles, Eſtates, Officers, and Magiſtrates of the ſayde Countreys, and Cities, can beare him good witneſſe: and that he was no whit partiall, but admoniſhed eyther partie to bee obedient and faithfull vnto his Maieſtie, as hee alſo ſo did in many other places where he had any dominion. Which thing may manifeſtly bee ſeene, by that that the Prince, by the grace of God, hath there reſiſted and letted, that in all theſe troubles and ſeditions, no Citie or Towne belonging to his Maieſtie, hath been endomaged, taken, or withdrawne either from his, or the Dutcheſſe obedience.</p>
            <p>And for confutation and ouerthrowe of the Count <hi>Hoogh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate</hi> his inditement, and the accuſation of his ambition: and for the holding of an aſſemblie in his caſtle of <hi>Hooghſtrate,</hi> or the conſpiring with the Countes of Egmont and Horne at Deure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, &amp; likwiſe his conſpiracie with the Prince of Orange, in ioyntly ioyning together in armes againſt his Maieſtie and the ſtopping with all their power and might the enteraunce of his armie into Brabant: The Prince proteſteth, and referreth himſelfe ouer to the teſtimonies of the Lordes that then were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled at <hi>Hoogſtrate,</hi> who can report whither any other matters were there treated of, then viſiting of one another, and to be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry together, in meeting of certain noble me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtrangers, their good friends &amp; kinſmen, neither ſhall it euer be prooued that any thing in that place was determined &amp; concluded vpon, that might any way, turn to his M. hurt. And again, they ſhall neuer be able, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proue, that he had been at any aſſembly either at Deuremond, or in any other place, about the conſulting &amp; conſpiring for the ſtopping of his M. arriuall into Brabant. But he right well vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth, that all theſe actions haue ſiniſterly bin enterpreted vnto his M. w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> hath greatly empayred his highnes louing affer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to wards him: For he had gotten y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> copy of a letter written by
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:11838:67"/>Francis of Alana, his M. ambaſſador in France, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Dutcheſſe, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> time &amp; place ſerued, the Countes of Egmond &amp; Horne, and the P. of Orange, ſhoulde be puniſhed as they had deſerued: but that in the meane while, they ſhould be gently and louingly intreated: and in the ſaid letter was alſo conteyned, that the troubles and commotions in Brabant were imputed to them.</p>
            <p>Thus here we ſee the principall cauſe of their aſſembly at Deuremond: But theſe noble men doe truſt and ſticke to their innocency: concluding none otherwiſe, but to propounde to the Dutcheſſe the contente of this letter, and to keepe them ſelues ſafe from it. And that which might be herein more talked of, hee truſted that the Lordes which were then in priſon had more at large declared the ſame.</p>
            <p>And as concerning the reſt of the articles of the inditement, to wit, that the Prince had counſelled the L. of Brederode, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie and fenſe his caſtle of Viane againſt his M. that is a very lie, and againſt all truth: But this is true in deede, that about certain yeeres paſt, the prince himſelfe, being at Vyane, the L. of Brede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rode ſaid vnto him: That the L. his father had appoynted him as it were by will, to make vp the ditches and rampares of Vyane already begun, whereupon he anſwered, that for the accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of his fathers will he would doe it: But there was not a word ſpoken of the king, neither had he once the heart to attempt any thing againſt him. And as touching the aduice of fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the nobilitie were in all times at their free choiſe and livertie to fortifie their Mannors when it pleaſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to the L. of Brederode: and although his anceſters haue bin in ſute for it, yet hath the L. of Brederode continued ſtil in peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able poſſeſſion. Wherfore there can be no matter of treaſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded vpon, in this behalfe: for that talke which they had toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was nothing els but about the fortifiyng of the ſayd Town, but no mention was made of his Maieſties affayres, and this conference was long before the time of theſe troubles.</p>
            <p>As touching the other point, that the Prince ſuffered the Lorde of Brederode to leuie men of warre at his pleaſure, in the Citie of Antwerpe, and ſent ſecretly to Vyane certayne muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt the Dutcheſſes Countermaund; The P. anſwereth,
<pb facs="tcp:11838:68"/>that hee came to Antwerpe, to deliuer the Citie from thoſe ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayne troubles: and when hee vnderſtoode the caſe, he aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed the Margraue thereof, who neuer founde out any thinge of the matter, but onely ſuche as were ſytting at a table, hauing Commiſſion to leuie men, howbeit they ſecretly got themſelues away.</p>
            <p>True it is that the Prince offered vnto the Lorde of Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derode, certayne peeces of Artillery that were made at Vtright, howebeit this was long before theſe troubles: and at that time it was about his Maieſties ſeruice, ſo that hee coulde not refuſe them, ſeeing that Vyane was not farre from Vtryght, and bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, hee had alſo required and demaunded them.</p>
            <p>And as concerning thoſe pointes, that the Prince ſhould forbid the receiuing of his Maieſties garniſonnes into certayne places and Townes, eſpecially in Zelande, where hee him ſelfe had ſent men of warre to take vp the place, and ſtoppe his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties enteraunce by ſea: As for the garnyſonnes, the Prince ſaith, that he neuer had it once in his thought to forbidde them, and if in caſe it be true they ought to tell, when, and at what time, and in what place this geare was wrought.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding when he was in Zealand, he was aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, that there was a practiſe to take Zealande, if it were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which was a matter of great importaunce, and therefore hee commaunded the Lorde of Boxtell, that no Garniſon ſhoulde be receiued without his leaue, for that is the maner of all Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunts.</p>
            <p>But when hee was afterwarde aduertiſed by the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne of the Rammekins, which was vnder his charge, that two hundred of the Dutcheſſes ſouldiers were there arriued, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring to haue the Caſtle opened vnto them, which the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne denied, howebeit hee was afearde of ſome muteny and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, by reaſon his people were vnpaide, and the Caſtle but hardly beſtead with victualles: hee commaunded him that no man ſhoulde entre into the Caſtle, without the Dutcheſſes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, and his leaue: whereof the Dutcheſſe being aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, was well pleaſed, and ſent them their pay: although the Dutcheſſe had been before otherwiſe informed, whiles ſhee lay at Bruxelles, and he in Antwerpe: and if the ſaide ſouldiers had
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:11838:68"/>entred the Caſtle, he muſt haue anſweared it. Moreouer, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werpians deſired y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they might haue no garniſons thruſt into their Citie, promiſing to be alwayes obedient vnto his Ma. and neither ſpare body nor goods to doe him ſeruice, no not once to hinder him in theſe affayres. It is very true that certeine ſmall veſſels were laden with ſouldiers to come to Antwerpe, who for the common quiet of the City could not bee ſuffered to enter, wherefore they ſayled towardes Zeland, where they were forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den &amp; ſtayed for comming on land: Inſomuch, that they inforced through famine, to returne to Antwerpe, and as it is ſayde, that as they were in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> L. of Brederode his ſeruice, being about a mile from Antwerpe, to wit, at <hi>Eaſterwell,</hi> and comming on lande, were there diſcomfited. When the reformed Churches of Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werpe heard of this, they armed themſelues to help the ſaid ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers: which cauſed a great alarme within the citie, ſo that the Prince in the ende appeaſed the ſame, without the effuſion of any citizens blood. By which bee gaue them to vnderſtand, that he neuer pretended to atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt any thing in <hi>Zealand,</hi> which might any way tend to the hinderance of any of his maieſties deuiſes &amp; practiſes.</p>
            <p>But in that he would not receiue garniſons into the country, and townes, he did that for the auoiding of all diſſention, and to keepe the ſubiects in peace &amp; vnttie. Wherfore the prince great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly marueileth that ſuch great learned men, as would be ſo well thought of, would ſet downe and propound ſuch matters, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer can nor ſhalbe any way verified.</p>
            <p>There is beſides in the Articles of this inditement declared, that the prince was ſent to Antwerpe to appeaſe the troubles, but that he ſuffered the exerciſe of all hereticall Sectes indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently.</p>
            <p>Whereunto he anſwereth, That hee expreſſely tolde the Counſell, that it was impoſſible for him to ſtay thoſe of the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: notwithſtanding that he woulde be as carefull to do what ſo euer lay in him to be done as a man mought be: Inſomuch that all the Townſmen gaue him great thankes, for the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the troubles through his aduiſe and counſell. The Magiſtrate of the Citie, and not he, ſuffered the building of the Churches, and the exerciſe of the religion, for the aueyding of a
<pb facs="tcp:11838:69"/>greater offence and miſchiefe.</p>
            <p>The Conſiſtories were ordeyned before he came thither: yea euen before the publique preachings: and to meete from thenceforth with al troubles, he permitted them a way or meane, whereby all the circumſtaunces of the affayres that might ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly happen, might be talked vpon and dealt withall: and did not belieue that his Maieſtie by this occaſion coulde any way be endemnified, ſeeing it ſerued more for the keeping of his ſubiects in peace and tranquilitie.</p>
            <p>For the laſt Article, where it is ſayde, that hee ſhoulde or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyne impoſitions and exactions, or leuie money for the paying of ſouldiers: hee fayeth, That he neyther ordeyned impoſitions, nor yet leuied mouey: But that that whiche was therein done, had beene done before hee came there, for the maintenaunce of the poore, and of the miniſters, and for the building of their Churches: wherefore it is very apparant and probable, that this money was not employed about his profit.</p>
            <p>Hereby alſo may very well be perceyued, that his meaning was not to impoſe any exactions, when as hee refuſed fiftie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Florines which were franckly offered him, for the good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice which hee had done. It was impoſſible to ſtoppe ſuche a thing, in ſuche a citie of Marchandize as Antwerpe, ſeeing that there is dayly greate ſummes of money diſburſed and layde out for diuers and ſundry thinges. Wherefore by theſe reaſons aforeſayde is ſufficiently ſet downe, that he was not the Author of the troubles.</p>
            <p>Theſe woordes and ſpeeches may ſuffice for the excuſe and defence of the Prince of Orange: with the which alſo accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the excuſe and defence of the L. of Hooghſtrate, ſauing that he hath anſwered, as thou haſt hearde vpon other pointes and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, as before hath been declared.</p>
            <p>Hitherto haue wee orderly ſet downe and declared, in what ſort the Duke of Alua arriued in the lowe Countreys with his men of warre, and of his whole proceedinges therein: And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe howe the Prince of Orange withdrew himſelfe, and procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all men to prepare for ſouldiers both on horſebacke and on foo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end to withſtand the fury of the blooddy tyrant the D. of Alua: who for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> defence againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inuaſion of his enemies, put
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:11838:69"/>him ſelfe in armes, and prouided men of warre, not onely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Countrey, but alſo without, becauſe he greatly preſumed that the baniſhed Lords, and the reſt that were fledde, woulde giue an attempt to returne into their poſſeſſions and enheritan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: ſo that, all his care was, how he might be able to hurte the enimy.</p>
            <p>And as the Duke of Alua had made all the prouiſion y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> might be for the warres to come, he cauſed all the goods, debtes, titles, and actions of the fugitiues and baniſhed men, to be confiſked, hauing made commiſſioners for the very purpoſe, who were bound to aunſweare to the hands of the ordinary Iudge, to dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the money into the Treaſurer of the warres poſſeſſion, for the paying of the ſouldiers and horſemen which were to be vſed about thoſe warres: which was the way to hurt his enemie, and to ſpare his maieſties purſe. Ouer and beſides, hee impoſed great exactions &amp; tollages, and leuied wonderfull ſummes of money vpon his mateſties credite, for the paying of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> garniſons, the building of caſtles, &amp; for the fortifying of the fronter &amp; border townes of the countrie: and to haue continuall ſtore of money for all occurrants whatſoeuer.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> beeyng dryuen out of theſe countries, and ſpoyled of his goods, not meanyng to do as the reſt of the counties had done, knew none other bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter way, then to excuſe himſelfe towards his king and prince: &amp; implored and pitifully beſought the aide of other potentates, to bee his interceſſours in that behalfe.</p>
            <p>And although the Emperour him ſelfe had done therein as muche as hee coulde, yet woulde not the king once liſten to him, nor yet vnderſtande the matter: But put ouer the Prince vnto the Duke of Alua to bee ordered by him, which thing he thought woulde neither bee good nor profitable for him, and therefore was of neceſſitie driuen to enter into armes with the ayde of his kinſfolkes, friendes, and fauourers, as well Germaines, as the lowe Countrey men.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, all ſuch as tooke part with him, and as yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned vnder the yoke of the Spaniardes, furniſhed him with all the money they were able to make, becauſe they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped thereby to recouer their loſt libertie. Now, when the Prince
<pb facs="tcp:11838:70"/>was thus prouided, he, by his brother Count Lodwickes helpe, procured an armie of footemen and horſemen, and for the better furthering of the cauſe, the Prince wrote to all the Princes and Lordes, complayning him ſelfe vnto them, of the tyrannie and extreeme wrong of the Duke of Alua, that hee had ſpoyled him of his goodes, hereaued him of his manners, landes, and tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, and contray to all right and equitie, had taken away the Count of Buren his ſonne, and ſent him ouer into Spaine.</p>
            <p>The Princes of Germanie were greatly diſpleaſed that the lowe Countreys ſhoulde thus bee oppreſſed by a tyrannous Spaniarde and Straunger: and therefore they aſſembled them ſelues together, to conſulte and deuiſe whiche way was beſt for them, to helpe the prince of Orange.</p>
            <p>The May following, there was muſtering of ſouldiers in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery place: But when the Duke of Alua hearde of it, he tooke order for the matter, and gotte him into the playne fielde: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that they which had firſt aſſembled them ſelues beyonde the Maze, and afterwarde about Dalham, which is a little towne in the Countrey of Iuilliers, whoſe chiefe &amp; Captayn was the Lorde of <hi>Hooghſtrate,</hi> were by the Duke of Alua his people diſcomfited, and a thouſande ſouldiers flayne: not regarding that they had committed that fact, within the Lande and iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the Empyre: Howebeit it is the naturall condition and propertie of Spaniards and Italians to bee alwayes too to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> proude, and thinke them ſelues better then all other nations: For it ſo fell out euen at that preſent, as that the gouernour of Hiniſverge and his Lieutenant who were come to Dalham to admoniſhe and ſummon the fugitiues and baniſhed men to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of the borders of the Duke of Iuillers his Lorde and Maſter, were there murdered and ſlayne as if they had been ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding all this, they which eſcaped and remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned were no whitte the more diſcouraged thereby, but inuaded his Maieſties lowe Countreys with Duke Lodwicke, and for the e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he Spaniardes, they were very well appoynted and fortified, and of all handes beſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them, entending to goe on with theſe warres, for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of religion, the defence of the priuiledges of the lowe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:11838:70"/>and for the reſtoring of the baniſhed men and fugitiues, into their ancient poſſeſſion and inheritaunce: whiche was the cauſe that ſome of them bare in their enſignes, this deuiſe or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, <hi>Recuperare, aut mori,</hi> that is to ſay: wee will eyther recouer our loſſe, or els loſe our liues.</p>
            <p>Wherefore many of the people aſſembled them ſelues in all quarters, in ſo muche that Count Lodwycke finding him ſelfe well ſtrengthened, tooke many townes and places, The firſt of which, was the Caſtle of Wedde, and after that, the Damme, in the Countrey of Groening.</p>
            <p>Nowe when the Duke of Alua hearde of this, hee waxed ſtarke madde, and doubting that his iolly felicitie might turne to to great miſerie: hee woulde in no wiſe giue Count Lodwicke any time to fortif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And ouer and beſides, fiue companies of the Regiment of the Count of Arenbergue. Howebeit all theſe people could doe Counte Lodwicke no hurte, becauſe his armie dayly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed.</p>
            <p>The Duke of Alua ſent thither Sir Iohn of Ligny Count Arenbergue, who was newely come out of Fraunce, with a Regiment of Spaniardes, and fiue enſignes of Almaynes, to ſet vpon the enemie, whiche hee did in deede, but to his great loſſe, before the Count Megue was come.</p>
            <p>The firſt ſkyrmiſhe was very brauely handled, in a place where a thouſande ſhot of the Count Naſious lay in wayte for the comming of the Count Arenbergue: Howebeit the night ſeparated them, and the Spaniardes retyred vnto their Campe: but the Count Naſſou in the night rayſed his Campe. When the day was come, the Spaniardes thought that the Count Naſſou and his people had fled, and therefore, they followed them. But when Count Lodwicke vnderſtoode, that there were no more horſemen but Curtius Martinengo his bande, hee charged the Count Arenbergue with three hundred horſes, and ouerthrewe tenne enſignes of Spantardes, and fiue companies of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynes.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:11838:71"/>
            <p>The Count of Arenbergue for the ſauing of his honour, defended him ſelfe valiantly: Howebeit his horſe was ſlayne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, and he falling to the grounde, was ſuddenly ſurpriſed by a ſhotte and ſlayne,

Certayne of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niardes fledde vnto a Monaſtery not farre from the place where the ouerthrowe was giuen, called Heiligher Lee, to hide and ſaue them ſelues: Howebeit they were forthwith ſette vpon, where, at the very firſt aſſault was ſlayn Count.

By this ouerthrowe, the Duke of Alua loſt ſixe peeces of great Ordinaunce with all their munition, but chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the count of Arenbergue, who was all his comfort.</p>
            <p>Ouer and beſides the great ſtore of money, which they had brought with them for the paying of their ſouldiers, their plate and other ritches, which the Naſſouans made good butin of. This battell was fought the 23. of May 1568. betweene Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligher Lee, and Winſchote in Friſelande, The Count of Aren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergue was buried in the Church of the ſaide Monaſterie, and the Count Adolfe at Welden.</p>
            <p>The 29. of May the Duke of Alua cauſed a Proclamation to bee placlaymed at Bruxelles: That all ſuch as were departed their Countrey, ſhoulde returne to their place of aboade, vppon payne of confiſcation both of body and goodes. The welthie fugitiues, were expreſſely named, howebeit fewe or none retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, becauſe they hoped of a better way, and a more conuenient time to do it.</p>
            <p>This diſcomfiture greatly greeued the Duke of Alua, but hee was auenged for it vpon the noble men, and Gentlemen, and other welthie Citizens whome he had in priſon, whoſe liues he tooke away.</p>
            <p>For the firſt day of Iune, he cauſed eighteene Gentlemens heads to be ſtriken off in the Horſemarket at Bruxelles:

And about Noone the Count Egmond was brought vnto the great market place, accompanied with the Byſhop of Ypre and other Church men: after them followed the Maiſter of the Campe to the Spaniardes, and Captayne Salines with nyenteene enſignes of Spaniardes, who marched on in order of battayle very well appointed, for the ſtaying of all diſorders and troubles, or for defence, if any of the Citizens ſhoulde haply make any ſtirre by reaſon of the ſayde Count. The Count was not bounde nor manacled, neyther yet guarded nor helde by any of the Seriauntes: For he had promiſed in the fayth of a knight that he woulde goe quietly to the place of execetion.</p>
            <p>In the market place was a Scaffoulde ſet vp, couered all ouer with black cloth, and aboue vpon it, two blacke Cuſhins, and two long yron poles. Below the Scaffolde was the knight Marſhall carrying a red wande in his hande, and the Hangman vpon the Scaffolde. The Count aforeſayde went vp with the Byſhoppe, and kneeling vpon a Cuſhin, after he had a while tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with the Byſhoppe, the hangman according to the maner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought him of Pardon, and the Biſhoppe withdrawing him bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde the Count, the Count, after he had caſt off his nyght gown of redde Damaſke and his veluet cloake layde on with parche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment lace of Golde, and his blacke cappe garniſhed with white feathers, couered his owne face with a Coyffe which he ware vnder his Cappe.</p>
            <p>Then, hee ioyning his handes together, and kiſſing the Croſſe, recommended him ſelfe to the mercie of God, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for death.</p>
            <p>The bodie was forth with put into a Coffen, and the place ſtayned with his blood, was couered with a blacke cloth.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:11838:73"/>
            <p>When this was done, the Count horne was brought foorth who beſought GOD to forgiue him his ſinnes, and wiſhed all bleſſed felicitie to al the ſtanders by, taking his leaue of them: and pulling a wimple ouer his eyes, after hee had layde downe his veluet Cloake, was executed as the other Count was.</p>
            <p>When this execution was accompliſhed, the Spaniardes retyred from the market place, ſauing two enſignes that kept the heades, which were ſet vpon the two iron poles: which were taken away about three of the clocke in the after noone, and laide with their bodies.</p>
            <p>Nowe Egmonds bodie was caried to Saint Clares Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bay, and Hornes, to the Cathedrall Church, and buried amongſt their predeceſſors tombes.</p>
            <p>The Count Egmonde his ſeruauntes had according to the cuſtome nayled vp his armes at his Court gate, but the Duke of Alua cauſed them to bee taken downe immediatly. All the worlde greatly complayned the death of the ſayde Count, and merueiloufly mourned for him.</p>
            <p>Theſe two Countes from the beginning tooke exceptions to <hi>Iohn du Boyes</hi> attourney generall, as an vnlawfull Iudge, and therein continued: For, they being Knightes of the order, coulde not be condemned nor iudged, but by the Knyghtes of the ſame order: Neuertheleſſe the Duke of Alua, hauing thereto no regarde, proceeded on, &amp; cauſed the ſayde ſentence to be pronounced.</p>
            <p>Many great men in auethoritie, and learned, and infinite number of others were marueylouſly abaſhed at this cruell ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and execution, pronounced and executed againſt the lawes and priuileges not onely of knightes of the order, but alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt all the whole lowe Countreys, yea againſt all ciuile and common lawe, ſeeing that the Count Egmond his araigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had not the full and ryght courſe of the lawe in ſuch a caſe prouided: Neuertheleſſe, they whiche nowe had the copye of the reſolution of the Inquiſition of Spayne, giuen by infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, which was taken by the Inquiſitours here aboutes and ſent ouer into Spaine: which reſolution, was graunted in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Madrid the ſixt of Februarie 1568. and beſides, the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that his Maieſtie pronounced in the ſayde Citie the 26.

            <p>Let vs now come againe to our firſt matter:
<note place="margin">The ſiege of Groening.</note> after that the Count <hi>Lodwike</hi> of <hi>Naſſau</hi> had gotten the victorie againſt the Spaniardes, hee diuided his ſouldiers into two companies, and beſieged the towne of <hi>Groening</hi> on both ſides, not without the great wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der of the whole world, in that he durſt without muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion take vpon him to ſet vpon ſuch a towne ſo ſtrongly fortified with walles and rampares, and ſo well victualed.</p>
            <p>The Counte <hi>Megue</hi> was in the ſaide towne with eyghte enſignes of Almaynes, and a thouſande Spaniardes: and <hi>Curtins Martinengo</hi> with three hundred horſe.</p>
            <p>The Townes men oftentimes ſallied out, and ſkirmiſhed,
<pb facs="tcp:11838:75"/>but chiefly the 22. of Iune when as the beſtegeants were gotten into certaine of the ditches, to trench. The horſemen were very forwarde, when as the <hi>Naſſouans</hi> were buſie to hynder the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng of the fort or trench, and made liuely ſkirmiſhes, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of the <hi>Naſſouans</hi> were ſlaine about two hundreth, and ſo were in lyke ſort a good many of Spaniardes. Captaine <hi>Martinengo</hi> alſo was in great perill of looſing his life, by reaſon that his horſe was gotten into a quackmyre. There was likewiſe one of the <hi>Gueſes</hi> taken, who, as himſelfe confeſſed, meant to ſet on fire di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places of the town: to the end that when the Citizens haue beene buſied about the quenching of the fire, the <hi>Naſſouans</hi> might the better haue ſcaled and wonne the towne. Whiche <hi>Gueſe</hi> was hanged by the appointmente of Captaine <hi>Alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During theſe exploites, <hi>Chiapin Vitelli</hi> had aſſembled as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men as he poſſibly could, and whiles the Duke of <hi>Alua</hi> was preparing of his things, he erected alſo his campe before the ſaid towne of <hi>Groening</hi> for the defence thereof, and the dryuyng a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of the <hi>Naſſouans,</hi> but it was all in vaine. There were then many ſkirmiſhes, &amp; many ſtratagemes and warrelike pollicies. Counte <hi>Lodwike</hi> at one tyme offered captaine <hi>Vitelli</hi> the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, but he would none of it: ſaying, That he had not as yet any opportunitie, becauſe he ſtill attended the Duke of <hi>Alua</hi> his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming with his armie.</p>
            <p>The Emperour, at the Duke of <hi>Alua</hi> his requeſt, ſent to Count <hi>Lodwike,</hi> and commanded him vpon paine of baniſhing the Empyre, to rayſe his campe from before the towne, and to get him out of the Countrie with as litle hurt doing as was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
            <p>Count <hi>Lodwike</hi> ſent him worde againe,
<note place="margin">Duke Lodwike his anſwere to the Emperour.</note> That hee could not doe it before ſuch time as he had aduertiſed the prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and the reſt of the Princes and Potentates his confederates thereof, and that then hee woulde make hym a ſhort anſwere. Notwithſtanding many of the Noble men of the Empyre were afraide of this meſſage, and thereupon returned home into theyr owne countries.</p>
            <p>Howbeit this ſiege of <hi>Groening</hi> continued vntyll the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng of the Duke of <hi>Alua,</hi> who, whiles hee was making of

            <p>When Count <hi>Lodwike</hi> hearde of this, hee rayſed his campe, and retyred towardes <hi>Embden,</hi> making hauocke of all thinges in his paſſage, breaking downe of bridges,

The Duke of <hi>Alua</hi> had ſent Duke <hi>Erycke</hi> with his horſemen to <hi>Groening,</hi> becauſe the territory about the towne was moyſt and ſoft, ſo that the horſe men coulde not paſſe it: and hee himſelfe with his foote men purſued Count <hi>Lodwike,</hi> hauing eſpials euery where to aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe him out of what quarter of the countrie counte <hi>Lodwike</hi> meant to goe.</p>
            <p>At laſt, the Duke was aduertiſed that counte <hi>Lodwike</hi> ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Iemming,</hi> in the count of <hi>Embden</hi> his dominions, and had there pitched his campe, beeing a fit place for intrenching, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideryng that on the one ſide hee had water enough, and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he had the iolly citie of <hi>Embden,</hi> to furniſh his campe with victuals and all other neceſſary prouiſion.</p>
            <p>When the Duke of <hi>Alua</hi> was heereof throughly aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, hee cauſed his army to marche towardes counte <hi>Naſſou</hi> his campe, and ſent before him, captaine <hi>Sancho de Auila,</hi> and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Mentero</hi> to holde them play and apply them with ſkirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, thereby to withdrawe the <hi>Naſſouans</hi> from the commodious place wherein they were. And after him, he ſent <hi>Iulian Rome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> maſter of the campe with fiue hundred harquebuziers &amp; three hundred muſketiers. After him, followed <hi>Don Sanches de Lodogno</hi> with a thouſande harquebuziers, appointed for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> two wings of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> foote men: and <hi>Caeſar Gonzage &amp; Martinengo</hi> with two bands of horſe men: the reſt of the vauntguard were vnder the conduct of <hi>Alfonſe de Vlloa,</hi> and <hi>Don Conſaluo de Braca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> with expreſſ commandement, that none of thoſe ſouldiers ſhould otherwiſe be placed.

<pb facs="tcp:11838:76"/>ſignes of Wallons: who followed the light horſe one by one: For the paſſage was very ſtraight, and full of water on eyther ſide.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Naſſouans</hi> ſawe the mightie armie of the Duke of <hi>Alua,</hi> in ſteed of ſhewing themſelues valiant and couragious they beganne to crie out, Money, money, and woulde not once fight, ſhewing themſelues to be neyther of valure, nor yet wiſe, and they who ſhoulde not haue fought for money, but for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of religion, durſt not nowe once put in hazard their liues, eyther for theyr countrie, or yet for religion. Whiche thinge when the Duke of Alua ſawe, and conſideryng of theyr puſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanimitie or faint heartedneſſe, ſet vpon count <hi>Naſſou</hi> his campe about ten of the clocke in the morning, and ſo put them to flight, and in killyng of a certaine number, he paid them the wages which count <hi>Lodwike</hi> ought them. Howbeit, many of them were ſaued in paſſing the ryuer of <hi>Embden</hi> by boate: and eſpecially the moſt valiant count <hi>Lodwike,</hi> and ſome of the noble men eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped the tyrants handes, notwithſtanding that hee ſtood to his defence euen to the laſt man: for when he ſaw that his ſouldiers woulde not fight, hee ſaued himſelf with great peryll of his life, by paſſing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> riuer in a very ſmall boat. The count of <hi>Hoogſtrate</hi> was but two dayes before gone from the campe, and count <hi>Iuſte</hi> of <hi>Scouwenbourgh,</hi> ſaued himſelfe and the greater number of his horſemen at the begynning of the battaile, when he perceiued the ſouldiers would not fight, but called ſtill for money.</p>
            <p>When the Duke of <hi>Alua</hi> had gotten this victorie,

            <p>In the beginning of September, the prince cauſed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> campe to marche on, after that they had made a generall muſter, and paſſed the <hi>Rhine</hi> at Saint <hi>Vit,</hi> a towne within his iuriſdiction.
<pb facs="tcp:11838:77"/>The Princes armie was 44 enſignes of <hi>Almaynes,</hi>

Vpon theyr Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rions were roſes painted, an olde Engliſhe deuiſe, as if the Queene of England had aſſiſted them. Ouer and beſides, the prince had ten peeces of ordenance, ſixe faucons, and four canons, but ſmall prouiſion of munition: and this was in harueſt, a very moyſt and raynie ſeaſon, and therefore very vnfit to marche with ſo great an armie.</p>
            <p>When the Duke of <hi>Alua</hi> had heard theſe newes at <hi>Vtright,</hi> he muſtered his people. The Colonel of the <hi>Alamaines,</hi> were the Count <hi>Lodyon,</hi> and count <hi>Phillip</hi> of <hi>Ouerſtein.</hi> Ouer and beſides, hee had fortie enſignes of Spaniardes, and fortie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes of VVallous, ſauing thoſe that lay in garniſon in the townes &amp; caſtles, who, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more part were Spaniards, &amp; who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he moſt truſted. Hee had alſo foure thouſande horſe of <hi>Spaniards Italians, Almaynes, Burgonions,</hi> and others. With this armie hee encamped before <hi>Maſtright</hi> to ſtay the enemie for paſſing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer at the Maze: hee made alſo a bridge ouer the Maze, that he myght euery way cut the enemie from victuals.</p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> tooke by aſſault <hi>Arenberg,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The prince ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth certaine places.</note> and <hi>Ep pen,</hi> two townes ſtanding betweene <hi>Coloigne</hi> and <hi>Duren,</hi> and <hi>Hormeſon</hi> alſo, belonging to king <hi>Philip,</hi> where his Ma. gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſon was ſtaine, which cauſed the Duke of <hi>Alua</hi> to ſpare none, eyther yet to receiue any to mercie. But as the prince marched ſtill for ward, the Duke knew not whether he wold into <hi>France,</hi> to ayde the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> or whether he would come downe into the lowe countries: howbeit the Princes armie coaſted the riuer of Maze euen vnto <hi>Stockum,</hi> where he paſſed the ryuer to meete with the Duke of <hi>Alua</hi> his campe.</p>
            <p>Whyle theſe matters were in hande, the Duke of <hi>Alua</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed aproclamation to bee made in <hi>Antwerpe:</hi> that euery man which had, or knew of any goods belongyng to the <hi>Gueſes,</hi> ſhold tell it to the Lorde Treaſurer, or to the magiſtrate and officer of

This Proclamation cauſed great miſchiefe.</p>
            <p>In the ende of September the Duke of <hi>Alua</hi> came on <hi>Maſtright</hi> ſide. The Liegeois woulde haue taken vp a certaine paſſage for the ſtopping of the armie: but the Prince marched with his people on the other ſide: and although there had beene a controuerſie between y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> biſhop and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Liegeois, yet they agreed by a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon conſent to leuie ſixe enſignes of men for the defenſe of the citie.</p>
            <p>The fifteenth of October the <hi>Orangians</hi> diſcomfited certain enſignes of <hi>Aluaianes.</hi> But when the Prince had paſſed the Maze, bee marched forwarde the twentieth of October, leauing on his right hande the towne <hi>Tilmont,</hi> and paſſed the riuer whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che diuideth the lande of <hi>Lieg</hi> from <hi>Brabant,</hi> ſeeking all the wayes he could to fight with the enemie: howbeit the Duke of <hi>Alua</hi> had no will to hazard it, and therfore fearing the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> his forces kept himſelfe in his trences before the Citie of <hi>Maſtright.</hi> But <hi>Don Fredericke of Toledo</hi> his ſonne, came one day out of the campe, with ſixe Culuerines, foure thouſand ſhot, and an hundred men at armes, but no great matter was exployted, ſaue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in ſkirmiſhing many on both ſides were thruſt out of wages.</p>
            <p>When the Prince ſawe that Winter drewe neere, and the time paſſed away, without giuing battaile to the Duke of <hi>Alua,</hi> who lay in his Trenches before <hi>Maſtright,</hi> although at the firſt the Princes armie might haue fought and diſcomfited the enemie, had it not beene through euill counſell, or els that the Lorde GOD would not ſuffer it, becauſe hee woulde further puniſh the lowe countries for their horrible and grieuous ſinnes.</p>
            <p>But nowe againe to our purpoſe: the Prince meaning to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde the vnprofitable charges in the conſuming and ſpending
<pb facs="tcp:11838:78"/>of victuals, money, and munition, thought it the beſt Councell, to forſake for a time the lowe Countries: and make a voyage into Fraunce: where the Marſhall <hi>Coſſey</hi> purſued him with two thouſand ſhot, &amp; two hundred horſe, which was to his great hurt. Whiche thing the Marſhall dyd at the requeſt of the Duke of <hi>Alua,</hi> and followed the Prince euen vnto <hi>Cambre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Frenche woulde gladly haue had the Germayne horſe men to haue come downe into Fraunce: But the greateſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them returned home into Germanie, for want of pay: and taking their way through <hi>Champaigne,</hi> entred into <hi>Lorayne,</hi> and beeing come neere vnto <hi>Straesbrough,</hi> they diuided them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, not well pleaſed with theyr pay, and thus ended this warr betweene the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Alua:</hi> who euer ſithence hath continued a more tyrannous perſecutor, in murderyng, empriſoning, cuttyng off of heads, hanging, bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, confiſking of goods, publiſhing of Proclamations and Commiſſions, and bringing in of newe Biſhoppes, as at <hi>Lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde</hi> in Friſelande, where <hi>Cunerus Petri</hi> was ordeined the firſt biſhop, the firſt of February 1568. And afterward were very ſolemnely ordeined certaine others, in the prouinces of the low Countries.</p>
            <p>Nowe, this tyraunts great perſecution and tyrannie afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaide continued from the yeere 68. vnto the yeere 72. When as the miſerable and comfortles inhabitaunts of the lowe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, had, through Gods aſſiſtance and mercy ſome eaſe of their calamities, by reaſon that the ſaide Duke obſtinately perſiſted in demanding of the tenth penny, without regard of the complaints of all the Eſtates of the lowe Countries, thinking thereby to heape vp ſuche an infinite treaſure, and keepe a continuall mine of golde and ſiluer, to withſtande all kinges, princes and poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, that woulde oppoſe themſelues againſt his vnnaturall ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie.</p>
            <p>And although the Lorde hath ſuffered this tyrant to bee a ſcourge to plague the lowe Countries, which ſometimes ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably floriſhed, yet hath it been to none other end but to aduertiſe vs, that we in the time of our great proſperitie wallowing and

The Cytizens who were at Churche hearing of this noyſe, came foorth, and draue the Walonnes cleane out of the Towne, and kepte the gates themſelues. When the Spanyardes were come before <hi>Fluſhing,</hi> they woulde not let them come in, whereuppon, they hearing that the garniſon of the Walons were driuen out, tooke their courſe to Middlebrough, the chiefe citie of the Iſle of <hi>Walcheren,</hi> where they were receyued.

            <p>Theſe iollye Merchants roſe very timely, and cauſed the Gates to bee opened, promiſing to giue the Porter a peece of money: But ſo ſoone as the Gates were open, they diſpatcht the Porter with a Piſtoll ſhot, and tooke away the keyes. When the Gates were open, counte <hi>Lodwike</hi> entred the towne with fortie men, and placed them at the corners of the ſtreetes: and if any man went about to open eyther dore or window, they would diſcharge their Pyſtols on the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, crying together with one voyce: you haue libertie, libertie, graunted you, the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> is come to ayde you, and you ſhall bee ſet free from the tenth pennie, and all other charges, wherewith the Duke of <hi>Alua</hi> woulde burden you.

            <p>The Duke receyuing newes of the taking of <hi>Mons,</hi> would not beleeue it, truſting more to the letters whiche hee had from the Frence king, by which he was aduertiſed, that count <hi>Lodwik</hi> had been a few dayes ſithence in Fraunce: howbeit by the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of the newes, hee did aſſure himſelfe that the Towne was taken: whereupon hee was caſt into ſuch a rage, as that he tare his garmentes, and troade vppon his cappe, ſtormyng and chafyng as if hee had beene out of his witte, and mad.</p>
            <p>But as the Duke of <hi>Alua</hi> was altogether put by, for reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtyng of his enemies, the Lorde of <hi>Lumay</hi> gotte hymſelfe by little and little to bee maſter of the Cities and townes of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande, who freely yeelded themſelues vnder the protection of the famous Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> although hee himſelfe was not there: for euery man deſired to bee deliuered from the ſlauery of the ſaid Duke and of the Spaniardes.</p>

            <p>This tyrannie of the Duke, ſo greatly feared the reſt of the Townes, that the count Berge forſaking all the Townes which hee had gotten, fledde from thence with all his ſouldiers. And ſo did likewiſe the count Scauwenbourgh in Friſeland, in memorie whereof, they of Sneecke enpryſonned their Patrone, the Lord of Netherwormter, whom they had ſent for, and with great ſolemnitie receiued into the towne.</p>

            <p>Duke Fridericke, the Duke of Alua his ſonne,
<note place="margin">A maſſacre at Narden.</note> and Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunt, came from zurphen, towardes Narden in Hollande, where hee ſo cruelly and vnnaturally handled the Citizens that had yeelded them ſelues, as that it is a fearefull thing to thinke on, and that, againſt all the lawes of armes, eyther in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or heatheneſſe.</p>
            <p>For, when the Spaniardes were entered, and louingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued, and had been as well entreated as was poſſible: there was immediatly after, proclaymation made by the ſounde of the Droombe, that all the Citizens and enhabytauntes of the Towne ſhoulde come to the Hoſpitall Chappell, where ſhoulde bee declared vnto them ſuche ordinaunces as they muſt line, and direct them ſelues by.</p>
            <p>But when the miſerable Citizens were come thither, the Spaniardes murdered euery mothers ſonne of them, ſackte and burnt the towne, rauiſhed the women, yea, and murdered ſome of them, and left the reſt liue in great Martyredome. Nowe, when I call to minde the wonderfull woorkes of God, I can not paſſe ouer but tell you, howe that after the murder and maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre of Narden, and the whole Towne on a flaming fire, a young ladde of the age of ſeuen yeeres was ſaued, by running out of the gates of the Towne into a little garden full of roots: The father of this Boy was murdered, and his mother beeyng rauiſhed, was hanged vp by the armes of the tyrannous Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes, and when the fire came and tooke holde of her houſe, ſhee being tyed by the armes, coulde not get away, ſo that ſhee was burnt in her owne houſe.</p>
            <p>This young ladde hauing not eaten any thing for the ſpace of three whole dayes together, wept bitterly both for the death of his Parentes, as alſo by reaſon that hee was hungerbit. But God who neuer forſaketh his, ſent him reliefe, for the very ſame night, there came vnto him a well fauoured young man in white apparell, who gaue him whereon to fedde, and ſayde: Weepe no more, my fatherleſſe childe, for I will neuer leaue thee.</p>
            <p>Eate, and be of good cheere, for they that haue murdered thy father and mother, ſhall haue a double plague light vpon them. Thy teares ſhal be turned into toy and gladnes, and their laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into teares and mourning: And forthwith the young man
<pb facs="tcp:11838:84"/>vaniſhed out of ſight.</p>
            <p>Thus wee ſee gentle reader, the mercifull and bountifull good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of God, who neuer forſaketh his, but keepeth them as the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of his eye.</p>
            <p>After the maſſacre and murder at Narden,
<note place="margin">Harlem beſiged</note> the Spaniards beſieged the Citie of Harlem.

               <hi>Don Fridericke</hi> of Toledo, the Duke of Alua his ſonne, through the counſell and aduice, both of the Boroughmaiſters of Amſtelredam, as alſo (which is very likely) becauſe he was loth to caſt away his ſouldiers, practized by trecherie and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like pollicie, with the Magiſtrate of Harlem, who partly fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, eſpecially, one Thyerrie a Friſelander ſomtime Boro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maiſter, in whome was repoſed the whole ſtate and dealing of the Towne, although he perfourmed not therein that duetie that hee ought to haue done, but purpoſed to deliuer all the people in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of the bloody tyrauntes, ſo that hee might haue his pardon, as manifeſtly appeareth by a letter that was ſent.</p>
            <p>The thirde of December in the yeere 1572. at ſeuen of the clocke in the morning, the great counſell of Harlem aſſembled
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:11838:84"/>by reaſon of a letter that was ſent, by one Maiſter Iames Wye, Curate of <hi>grand Beginage</hi> ſecretely written, and directed to a Brother of his that was then in the Towne, conteyning the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannies which the Duke and his people had committed in many Townes, but that if ſo be any would craue pardon, hee woulde graunt it them.</p>
            <p>When the Magiſtrate had cauſed this letter to be red in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen counſell, hee aſked the opinion and aduiſe of them that were there, whither it were beſt to ſende to <hi>Don Fridericke</hi> or no: Wherein (alas) was the counſell of <hi>Achitophell</hi> followed, and for the bringing of it to paſſe, there went out ſecretly at Spaer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wouwer gate, vpon a ſled drawen on the yſe, the aforeſayde Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erry the Friſtander, Thriſtopher Schagen, and Adrian of Aſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delft the penſioner, telling the Wagonner nothing els, but that they would goe to Sparendam. But ſo ſoone as they were come vnto the banke or dike, they ſaide vnto him, bring vs halfe way, and from thence to Sloterdike, where the Wagonner ſet them on lande, and would bring them no further, ſo that they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to foote it to Amſtelredam.</p>
            <p>The ſame day were the ſworne men of the Towne of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, ſommoned to appeare at two of the clocke in the afternoone at the croſſebowe Archers Garden, where alſo appeared Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayn Weybout Repperda, Sir Launcelet of Brederode, Adrtan Ianſons Marſhall of Harlem, and Stuner the Boroughmai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, when theſe ſworne men were aſſembled, Captayne Ripper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da began his oration, and ſayde: Worſhipfull Citizens, the cauſe of your aſſembly here in this place, is a letter that was ſeat to one of our Citizens, contayning, that as yet there is fauour &amp; grace to be had at <hi>Don Fridericke</hi> his handes, to the which ende, Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erry the Friſelander and others are gone to Amſtelredam.

               </gap> of the grace that you are like to haue at his handes, as alſo of the othe whiche you haue made to the Prince of Orange, I doubte not but that you your ſelues, aſ well as I my ſelfe, will do all you can to obſerue it.</p>
            <p>For, I am fully determined, ſo long as I haue one drop of blood in my body, to hazarde my ſelfe for the defence of the Citizens of this Citie, and therefore if you your ſelues bee of the ſame
<pb facs="tcp:11838:85"/>opinion, tell mee your mindes bouldly: Whereupon, the ſworne men anſwered all with one accorde, that for the defence of their Countrey, they woulde hazarde both their bodies and goodes: ſo that after many other louing exhortations, they brake vp, and euery man departed home to his owne houſe. Howebeit the ſayd Captayne and Marſhall wrote forthwith vnto the Prince of Orange, declaring vnto him the ſtate of the towne.</p>
            <p>They wrote in like maner vnto the Colonnell Maiſter La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus Muller, who lay at newe Dam with tenne enſignes of foote men, willing him to ſende to Harlem ſome of his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie: Whereupon the ſayde Muller, departed from the ſame place with all his Regiment, and paſſing through baſe or lowe Hollande, came to the ayde of Harlem.</p>
            <p>So that hee, arriued there the fourth of the ſayde Moneth with tenne enſignes, foure of which went into the towne: whoſe Captaynes were, captayne Stenbach the Colonels Lieutenant, Chriſtopher Vader, Lambarde of Wirtenberge, and Martin Pruys.</p>
            <p>And the ſelfe ſame day were the Churches ridde and clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of all the Idols and filthie Imageries, that the pure worde of God might there be preached.</p>
            <p>The fifth of December, returned from Amſtelredame Chriſtopher Schagen, and Adrian Aſſendelft the pencioner, who were forthwith ſent as priſonners to the Prince of Orange. The ſame day was brought vnto the Towne, from a place called the fiue houſes, a meſſenger of Amſtelredam by Thierry the Friſelander, to the Boroughmaiſters of Harlem: Howebeit when the ſayde meſſenger was come neere to the Towne, hee durſt not come in him ſelfe, but ſent his letter by a Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: The which meſſenger after he had been examined and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was hanged all but the head.</p>
            <p>The 6. of the ſame moneth, the enemie came to Sperwouwe, and ſkyrmiſhed, to ſmall purpoſe, with thoſe of Sparendam. Whereupon, the Boroughmaſters and Captaynes ſent the next morrowe three hundred ſouldiers to ayde Sparendam, vnder the charge of Martin Pruys then Captaine. The ſame day, the enemie returned and ſkirmiſhed, &amp; the Sparendames luſtily ſaluted them with their great ordinaunce.</p>

            <p>And hee further ſayde, that his excellencie did it not for that he meant, any way to diminiſh the Priuiledges thereof, but for the preuenting of a miſchiefe: And therefore, he very louing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly required and prayed the ſworn men, that euery diziner would bryng in the voyces of his companions, for the chuſing of eight Boroughmaiſters, fourteene Sheriffes, and twentie Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours to rule the next yeere.</p>

The ſame day were ſome of the olde magiſtrates, being ſuſpected becauſe they had yeelded vnto <hi>Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erry</hi> the Friſelanders commiſſion kept in theyr houſes. And they which <hi>Monſieur</hi> Saint <hi>Aldegond</hi> had appointed to the gouernement are theſe which follow. Burroughmaſters, Nicholas Laen, Iohn Vliet, Gerrard Stunyer, Peter Keys. Shiriefs.

            <p>The 12. of the ſaide moueth, vnto the 17. the enemy appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and trenched, by reaſon of the fauoure of the Bulwarkes which were dayly made: and on the other ſide, the Towneſmen verie carefully fortified their Towne where they ſawe it moſte needefull.</p>
            <p>The 18. of December, at 8. of the clocke in the mornyng, the Spanyardes began to batter the inward gate of S. Croſſe, and both the flankers thereof, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> bullets of 40. &amp; 46. pound waight, diſcharging 14. Canons at once: The towneſmen againe ſate not ydle, but cherely fortified their Rampares with wood, earth, ſtones, wooll ſacks, and other things. About midnight y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſworne

            <p>The 19. of the ſaid moneth, the enemy continued the battery againſt S.

            <p>The 20. of the ſaid moneth, the enemy continued the batterie againſt the Bulwarke vntil about noone, &amp; ſhot an hundreth and fiftie ſixe times, and then made readie to the aſſault: wherevpon the Alarme Bell ſounded out. The enemy on euery ſide had ſet a guard before the gates both of footemen and horſemen, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout one of the clocke in the after noone, came with enſignes diſplaied from the Spittle to the towne, carrying on their ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders bridges ready made, to caſt ouer the ditches, and ſo paſſe to the Bulwarke. Ouer and beſides this, they had furniſhed their trenches with Hayquebuziers, continually ſhooting at the wals and Rampares, to the end they might take away the Curtines from the towneſmen. Now, as they aſſaulted the Bulwarke, the towneſmen ſo liuely beat them backe with chayne ſhot, &amp; from the Courtines ſo liberally hayled them with ſmall ſhot, as that they made them giue ouer the aſſault: which thing the enemy ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing renued the aſſault with f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>In the euening when the aſſaulte was ended, they tooke a

            <p>The 28. was Peter Iohnſons the enginare of the towne ſlayne with Harquebuze ſhot, ſo that he was put by for repairing of the Bulwarke, and dyed the next morrowe.</p>

            <p>The laſt of this ſaide moneth, there iſſued out of the wood gate certayne Horſemen, meaning to ſurpriſe the watch, but all in vaine, for the time was too cleare, and the enemie fled, ſo that,

            <p>The firſt of Ianuarie 1573. the Towneſmen made a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſad, and iſſued out of the wood gate, comming ſuddenly vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Spaniardes in their trenches, who forſooke them: But the enemie returning with a greater number, the Towneſmen alſo returned carrying away with them but two Countreymen, and a young ſtrypling.</p>
            <p>The 2. of the ſaid moneth, were brought into the ſayd towne, twelue fleds laden with wheat, and one loden with bread, came in at Scaelwyke gate. But the 5. of the ſaide moneth, entred 27. fleddes laden with corne, &amp; a band of ſouldiers, vnder the charge of captaine Mandares.</p>
            <p>The 8. of the ſayde moneth, the Towneſmen hunge vp a ſouldier on the toppe of the Bulwarke: and the enemie whiche had giuen ouer battering, from the 20. of December vnto that day, beganne agayne the battery with 24.

            <p>The 10. day at night were ſent, for the ayde of the Towne of Engliſhmen, Scottiſhmen, Walons, and Almaynes, about two thouſande: But by reaſon of the wonderfull myſtie and cloudie weather, they went out of theyr way, inſomuch, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them got to an houſe, called the clyffe, ſome to the downs, others to the wood: Howebeit, the greateſt number went to the Princes Campe, by reaſon they coulde not hitte vppon the Towne, and yet there was a great light burning vpon the top of the Tower, and the Bell alſo was rounge, whiche was the cauſe that ſome of them got to the Towne, amongſt whom, was an Almaine, one of the enemies Campe, who aſked them of the town, which were come out of Scaelwike gate to ſkirmiſh, whether he were neere Amſtelredam yea or no: who anſwered and ſayde yea, and ſo tooke him, and led him to the Towne, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonner, where, to be ſhort, he was hanged: This day, the enemie had diſcharged 14.

            <p>The 12. of the ſaide moneth, the enemie had with batterie, greatly decaied the Bulwarke, <hi>Parapetti, Maiſons,</hi> houſes, cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and Churches, yea, had almoſt as it were, vtterly beaten them downe, with the valee of an 150.

And beſides all this, the enemie had wrought by all meanes poſſible to haue myned hard vnder the houſe whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che ſtood in Saint Croſſe ſtreete.</p>
            <p>The 13. day, there entred ſixe ſteddes, laden with Corne and Meale: And the Towneſmen alſo ſounded the Alarme, when as they ſawe the preparation of the enemie.</p>
            <p>The ſame day likewiſe, were two men ſlayne as they ſatte at the Table eating of their meate, with a Canon ſhot, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with alſo, a mayde ſeruaunt: howebeit, there was a locke of hayre of a young Damoſell cleane carried away couercheffe and all, with an Harquebouze ſhot, without any other hurt.</p>
            <p>The 14. day the Towneſmen ſallied out, and tooke three victuallers, and two Almaynes priſonners, and brought them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with them.</p>

            <p>The 16. of Ianuarie in the forenoone, the Spaniardes had caſt an head out of their trenches vnto the Towne Bulwarke, whereunto was tyed a little ſcrowle, written with theſe wordes: This is king Philip his head the Captayne: Whereupon, the Towneſmen in recompence of this villanie cauſed twelue pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonners to be hanged, to witte, Three victuallers of Amſtelre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, a Walon, and eight Almaynes.</p>
            <p>The night following when the dead men were cut from the

Vpon the head of which barrell was nayled a peece of paper written with theſe wordes: Carrie theſe heades to the Duke of Alua, in payment of the teuth pennie, which hath been ſo long demaunded and not yet payed: and therefore beſieged he this Towne: But for aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he ſhall haue no iuſt cauſe to complayne, by reaſon it hath been ſo long a comming, wee haue ſent him the eleuenth, for intereſt, and in conſideration.</p>

The ſame day, the ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers &amp; others ſallied out at Scaelwike gate, to ſkirmiſh with the Almaynes, who had fortified at Ruſtenbourg houſe: and firſt they woone the watermyll, which the enemie had forſaken, and after that, entred the trenches at once, and draue out the enemie, ſending into another worlde as many as they could catch: where the enſigne bearer of Briell, valiantly got an enſigne out of the hands of one of the enſignes bearers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enemy, &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The 18. of the ſaide moneth; the Towneſmen beganne to fortifie Saint Croſſes Gate, and ſtrengthned it with earth, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gottes, Horſe dungge, and other thinges, enterlaſing it with tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber logges after the maner of a Gridiron, ſo that this gate was a greate deale ſtronger then the Bulwarke aforeſaide. The ſame day the townes men ſallied out of <hi>Scaelwike</hi> gate to ſkirmiſhe with the <hi>Almaines,</hi> but it was to ſmall effect.

            <p>There was but one ſouldier of the Towne that dyed in that ſkyrmiſhe, and hee was an Engliſhman. In the euening, <hi>Mounſieur de Vemi,</hi> a valiant Captayne was ſhotte throughe the arme with an Harquebuze, as he was on the new Bulwark of the ſaide gate.</p>

But becauſe the Almaynes marched not euenly with the Wallons, who were not able to vnderſtande what the Almaynes did by reaſon of the Bulwarkes, notwithſtanding that they had a figne giuen them out of the Towne by the blow of an Harquebuze, that they ſhoulde not all at once ſet vpon the enemie, they were enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to retyre to the towne, with loſſe both on the one ſide and on the other.</p>

            <p>This aſſault was to bee giuen by the Spaniardes, Almaines, and Wallous: to wit, by the Spaniardes and Almaines from Saint Croſſe gate downe all alongeſt the ouerthrowne Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares, vnto S.

And the Walons to giue the aſſault at the ſaide Saint Iohns gate, who had alreadie gotten the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage of the ſaid gate and Rampares, before any of the townes men perceiued it.</p>
            <p>Now, as the enemie had this great adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> townes men whiche coulde no way be recouered without great effuſion of blood, if God by his grace had not prouided for it, the ſouldters &amp; ſworne men which watched this night in that quarter, ſo ſoone as it was day, had quickly perceiued it: wherfore fiftie or three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore of them luſtily charged them betweene the gates, and valy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly pealed them with harquebuze ſhot, crying alarme, whiche noyſe awaked them that were there about, &amp; made them runne with their weapons to the Rampares, and ſo did likewiſe al the townes men, charging the enemie very couragiouſly, ſo that therein they ſiue many, and beate backe the reſt from the toppe, downe beneath the walles and Rampares, ſo that all the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes, Wallons, and Almaines, were in a ſhort tune diſpatched in great numbers: for they ſo valiantly withſtood the enemie, as that there coulde not a man ſo ſoone peepe aboue the Rampare but that hee dyed for it.</p>
            <p>The ſtrongeſt aſſault that the enemie gaue, and were moſt in number, was, at the olde bulwark at Saint Croſſe gate, which the enemie had gotton hard by the new fort, that the townes me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had fortified, and the enemie, for the giuing of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aſſault, had vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermined it, becauſe they meant to winne it by maine ſtrength.
<pb facs="tcp:11838:91"/>But they within, had ſo countermined, and made ſuch a pit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe vnder the breach, &amp; put into it certaine barrels of powder and ſuch other like ſtuffe, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in giuing fire thereto, when as the Spaniardes, with enſignes diſplayed, were in greateſt number gotten vp to the topp of the walles, they ſo luſtily beſtirred them ſelues, as that the myne and as many as were vpon it, and there about, were blowne vp into the ayre: ſo that a great number of the enemies were ſent to heauen headleſſe, armeles, and legles, yea torne and rent in peeces, beſides thoſe that there were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried.</p>
            <p>It was a feareful thing to ſee, howe the heads, armes, and legges, yea, &amp; whole bodies alſo, harquebuzes, halberdes, rapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and drummes, flewe vp into the apre. Ouer and beſides al this, the Townes men got them into the trenches of the enemie, and ſlue of them in great numbers, as many as were not able to flie thence. They diſcharged alſo a demie Serpentine &amp; other yrou peeces, amongeſt them which ſtood in order of battayle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Saint Iohns gate, making therewith great ſlaughter of the enemie: which cauſed the Spaniards and Wallons retyre with ſhame enough into theyr trenches, carrying away all their dead that were of any reputation, as faſt as they coulde. In this aſſault, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cownes men y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were deadly hurt, was captaine Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bart of <hi>Wirtzenbourgh,</hi> who ſhortly after yeelded vp y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ghoſt to God.</p>
            <p>Whyles the Spaniardes gaue the aſſault at Saint Croſſe gate, and Saint Iohns, there entred in at <hi>Scaelwike</hi> gate <hi>170.</hi> ſleddes laden with corne and other victuals, which came from the Princes campe, with a <hi>conuoy</hi> of <hi>300</hi> ſhot, and about <hi>70.</hi> horſe, vppon the yſe: who were purſued euen vnto <hi>Harlem</hi> gates with an hundred horſe, and certaine ſhot, to haue taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way theyr victuals, but all in vaine, howbeit in very deede the Princes Cornet bearer, and one other of that companie loſt their liues.</p>
            <p>In the euening the Burroughmaſters ſent two meſſengers with letters to his Excellencie, who immediately vpon theyr re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, brought with them an Almaine horſe man priſoner that was ryding towardes the wood to his companie.

            <p>The firſt of Februarie, ſalied out of <hi>Scaelwyke</hi> gate <hi>27.</hi> horſemen to mainteine a ſkirmiſhe, but they encountred with no man ſaue an <hi>Almayne</hi> ſouldier, whom they brought to the towne.</p>
            <p>The ſecond of the ſame moneth, the townes men were aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed that the euemy had made a bridge with boates about the Barnardynes, to paſſe ouer certayne horſemen for the cutting off of the ſleddes of the towne which brought in their victualles: wherefore <hi>36.</hi> horſemen and <hi>600.</hi> on foote ſalyed out of the towne in the morning through the fauour of the Bulwarkes: But when they coulde finde no bridge, they returned, bryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging with them a Walon, and a young ſtripling, who were in an houſe neere <hi>Scaelwyke.</hi> The ſame day was an Alarme gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</p>
            <p>The <hi>3.</hi> of the ſaide moneth, was proclaymed by the ſounde of the bell, that a loafe of bread of fixe pounde weight ſhoulde not be ſolde for aboue two patartes, and a pounde of Cowe cheeſe for halfe a braſſe pennie, a pot of ſweete mylke, a groat and an halfe, and a pounde of butter two ſouls. The menne at Armes and certayne Harquebuziers ſalyed out of the wood gate in the morning to mayntayne a ſkirmiſh, &amp; found certayne Spaniſhe horſe, whereof, one horſe and two menne at Armes of the enimye whiche went from the ſkyrmiſhe, were ſiryken with a canon ſhotte that came out of the forte of the ſayde gate.</p>
            <p>The fourth of the ſayd moneth, ſalyed out at the ſaide gate the men at armes with certayne Harquebuziers, who conuay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed certayne emptye ſleddes as farre as the <hi>Mere,</hi> whiche went for Corne: where the horſemen fell vpon the enemye, howebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it they parted fayrely without anye hurte doyng. The ſame daye, the enemye thought to giue fire to the myne whiche they them ſelues had made, at Saint Croſſe gate, thinking thereby, greatly to endamage the towne, but it was by Gods grace ſo preuented with a Countermyne, as that the Townes men gaue fire to the myne, where they diſpatched a greate manye, both of Souldiers and Pyouers, without any hurt or loſſe to the towne.</p>

            <p>The <hi>5.</hi> of February in the afternoone, were <hi>8.</hi> ſleddes laden with victualles brought into the Towne, whiche came from his Excellencies campe: and the ſixt daye there wente to the Prince Caprayne <hi>Vemi,</hi> and with him <hi>Adrian, de Berquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roede,</hi> for the ſending thither of victualles, and other thinges neceſſary, the alarme alſo was giuen, but nothing came of it.</p>

            <p>The <hi>9.</hi> of Febr. the enemy began within the Bulwarke at S. <hi>Croſſe</hi> gate, which the townes men had giuen ouer, their plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme of earth and tymber logges, for the planting of their artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary there, that they might thereby batter at their pleaſures. the Walles, Rampares, Bulwarkes, houſes, and ſtreetes of the towne.</p>

The ſame day, by the aduiſe of the Borroughmaiſters and Captaynes of the towne was ordeined, that a newe Ditche and Rampare ſhoulde bee made like an halfe moone: for they were afearde that the enemie woulde vndermyne the ſaide Forte or Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke, whiche in the ende they beate downe, which Ditch and Rampare was with one conſent, and great diligence begun and finiſhed: ſo that there was no man abſent at the doing of it, but Borroughmaiſters, head Officers, Captaynes, Lieuetenants, Citizens, Souldiers, Souldiers wiues, and Pages, laye at it daye &amp; night: Inſomuch that it was quickly diſpatcht &amp; made an end of.</p>
            <p>The eleuenth of the ſayd moneth, an Almayne comming from the entrie of the woode, paſſed by boate ouer <hi>Spare,</hi> and giuing a ſigne with his Cappe: came towardes the Towne, deſiring to comein: and beeyng in the Towne, aſked for Captayne <hi>Steinbach,</hi> ſhewing Letters whiche were written vnto him.

            <p>The <hi>26.</hi> of the ſame moneth the great Gally of <hi>Harlem,</hi> got before all the reſt of the men of warre, and entred the Mere, where ſhee fell amongſt a doſen men of warre of <hi>Amſtelredam,</hi> whereupon foure or fiue of them began to aſſayle her to haue clapt her a bord, before ſuch time as ſhe perceiued that they were their enemies, ſo that ſhee loſt ſome of her men: But Captaine Gerard the younger beeing hurt, ſaued himſelfe and his lieuete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in a ſmall veſſel, leauing his people in danger, whome the enemie foorthwith ouercame: an houre or two after the loſſe of the great Gally, came the little Gally of <hi>Harlem</hi> (vnder the charge of Captaine <hi>Iames Antony</hi>) with other ſinall men of warre, who valiantly recouered the great Gally, and wonne of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enemie a new Caruell, killing as many as were within boord, ſaue three, whome they brought to <hi>Harlem,</hi> one of them beeing a Gentleman of <hi>Louayne,</hi> named <hi>Ranſcot,</hi> and the <hi>Harlemians</hi> returned to <hi>Fuyke</hi> hauing playd the tall ſouldiers. The ſame day alſo entered into <hi>Harlem</hi> certaine ſmall veſſels laden with victuals.</p>
            <p>The 27. of the ſaid moneth the ſaide Gallies once againe met with the enemie, and put the <hi>Amſterdamians</hi> to flight: wher vpon the <hi>Harlemians</hi> ſtopped the hole which the <hi>Amſterdami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> had made, with boates, ſtones, and other things.</p>

            <p>The third day of Marche, the Harlemians ſet a woorke and played with the great ordenance before named: for, as the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie had made a platforme before the Fortor Bulwarke, Iohn Coningham the Scottiſhe Lieuetenant played ſo luſtily with the battery, as that in halfe a day hee had beate it ſmooth to the grounde.

            <p>The twelfth of Marche came victualles into Harlem, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larme was giuen.

            <p>The ſeuenth of the ſaid moneth the townes men ſalied out at Scaelwyke gate, thinking to haue cowpled together in ſkir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhe, but it was to ſinall purpoſe. And the eight of the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the townes men fired a myne, but it auayled little.</p>
            <p>The nienth of this moneth, came, as it were about an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of the Princes ſhips from Caghe towardes Fuyke. And the harlemians hauing a doſen well appointed ſhippes, firſt ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with a great large veſſell vnto a bridge neere vnto the wood, where ſhee ſtayed without being able to paſſe or yet ſtirre: And the ſecond which was a Caruel flayed againſt the low dyke. But as two hundred ſouldiers or there about ſalying out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> water gate to ſet vpon the enemie, were liuely repulſed: the ſouldiers which were in the great veſſell, and in the Caruell, came out of them, and ſome of them came on ſhoare in a boate, leauing both the ſhips in the power of the enemie. The others ſeeing that the bridge woulde not ſtyrre, forſooke alſo both their veſſels, and in ſkirmiſhing retyred to the towne with the loſſe of ſixe or ſeuen of their companie: in the meane while, our veſſels kept them of Amſterdam, whiche lay before Fuyke, play, by reaſon of the Northeaſt winde, &amp; the fort of Fuyke, where the Spaniardes were prouided of great ordenance, they coulde not come to grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with the enemie: Wherefore our men in the euening ſayled thence, and ſo reſted themſelues for that night. There was alſo in the eauening a ſkirmiſh vpon the Sommer way, and at night were two alarmes ſounded.</p>
            <p>The tenth day of Aprill were ſent out of Scaelwyke gate foure Poſtes to the Princes ſhippes. The ſame day the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:11838:95"/>euemie had made a long trenche, which raught from the wood hard to Fuyke, ſo that none could come out of the towne, but muſt needes fall into their lappes.</p>
            <p>The <hi>11.</hi> of the ſaide moneth, the Princes ſhippes were come to Hemſteede, whiche made the townes men thinke that they woulde ſet ſom men a ſhoare: ſo that for the helping of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, there iſſued out of the wood gate about <hi>150.</hi> ſouldiers, out at the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter gate about <hi>500.</hi> and out at Scaelwike gate. <hi>200.</hi> But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the veſſels approched not, yet the ſouldiers were hoatlie chaſed backe, and two of the Captaines were hurt by their owne ſouldiers. The ſame day, ſeauen or eight of the enemies had deſperately gotten vp vnto the fort or Bullwarke with two en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, crying, victorie, victorie, the towne is ours. But the ward ſo luſtily repulſed them, as that one of the enſigne bearers was left behind dead, with his enſigne.</p>
            <p>The <hi>14.</hi> of this moneth in the night came three meſſengers thwart the fieldes in at the wood gate, and ſo did alſo three other meſſengers, the night following. The <hi>15.</hi> day, the townes me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> put the fourth Gallie to the Mere, being <hi>180.</hi> feete by the keele. And the ſeuenteene day were three meſſengers ſent towards the Prince.</p>
            <p>The <hi>18.</hi> day of Apryll entred Ierome Serrates and the L. L. Roſoni, Bordell, Dorhem, Maligau, and others, to the number of fifteene, and with them certaine men laden with powder.</p>
            <p>The <hi>19.</hi> day the Princes ſhippes had ſet on lande at the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the fiue houſes, two thouſand ſouldiers to ſkirmiſhe with the enemie: But by reaſon of the long wayting, for the Harle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians, nothing was done. The ſame day was an aduenturer ſent towardes the Princes ſhippes, who, although he was haſtily purſued by the enemie, thwart their campe, yet, maugre theyr heardes, hee returned ſafe and ſounde. The ſame day at night Captaine Baufoure with his ſcottiſhmen, and certaine citizens, ſalying out at Scaelwike and Sparewouwer gates, made a camyſado and tooke by force Ruſtenbourgh houſe, and diſpatcht a good many of the enemies.</p>
            <p>The 20. of Apryll, there came from Fuyke certaine Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,
<pb facs="tcp:11838:96"/>ſome by Gally, and ſome by lande, to recouer Ruſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brough, howebeit they were ſo luſtily repulſed by the townes men, as that they were faine to retyre. The ſame day were ſent from Harlem to the Prince foure Poſtes or meſſengers. And the 21. of the ſaide moneth an alarme was giuen to the towne.</p>
            <p>The 22. of this moneth, they y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were taken in the trenches of Ruſtenbrough, were hauged without Scaelwyke Gate. The ſame day, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ships of the Mere, brauely ſkirmiſhed, howbeit to ſmall purpoſe. And the next day, there reentred at Scaelwike gate, foure poſtes: and others ſent a way out at the wood gate.</p>
            <p>The twentie and foure of the ſaide moneth entred in at the wood gate, 24. Citizens of Harlem, bringing with them pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and then was an alarme ſounded at the towne. The ſame day at night iſſued a good number of Engliſhmen, Scottes, Walons, and Pyoners, and went towardes Spiquerbord hole, but returned without doing of any thing, and ſo leuelled the worke begun.</p>
            <p>The 25. day of Apryll at fiue of the clocke in the after noone the enemie came in, on three ſeueral partes, to ſkirmiſh vppon Ruſtenbrough, but was faine for all that in the end to retyre. The ſame day the enemie gaue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> alarme, to the loſſe of ſome of theyr owne conpanie. The next day, there departed from Harlem foure poſtes in one Barque towardes the Princes ſhips: but the 27. day came into Harlem two ſmall veſſels laden with powder, thwart y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fields &amp; ditches. And immediatly after was an alarme giuen.</p>
            <p>The 28. of this moneth, the townes men, about eight of the clocke at night blewe vp a myne, whereupon certaine Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes and others were well cooled: whiche was the cauſe that made them diſcharge eighteene Canon ſhot, wherewith they flue Captaine Henry Laſſens, and one Chriſtopher Scagen Gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The ſame day went out foure ſouldiers to ſurpriſe certaine warders, to wit, the one beeing neere the wood, and the other in the way to the wood: but becauſe the ſaide warders coulde nor ſee the way to bee gone before, it coſte them theyr liues.</p>
            <p>The next day, there went out enbarqued, at Scaelwike gate
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:11838:96"/>certain meſſengers, and ſayled towards the princes ſhips, where they arriued without ſtay, as well appeared by a token of the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which they gaue.</p>
            <p>The laſt of this moneth ſalied out the Princes guarde to ſkyrmiſh with the enemie, in whiche their captaine Margotin was flaine. About this time the townes men had coyned certaine peeces of gold, with the armes of Harlem on the one ſide, &amp; their owne poſey on the other: <hi>Vincit vim virtus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt day of May entred into the towne two men, who being chaſed by the enemie, forſooke both their veſſels, wherein they had 800. li. of pouder, which they thought to haue brought into the towne. And the ſecond of this moneth entred a boy of fifteene yeeres of age, in at the wood gate as a meſſenger, with eight pound of pouder, ſaying, That the Burroughmaſters of Leiden had ſent him, and that he was to haue back with him two meſſengers of the towne. This boy was kept pryſoner, as one ſent by the enemie.</p>
            <p>The third day of this moneth was a through ſearch made in all the citizens houſes both rich and poore, about the making of an Inuentorie of all the victuals, that were not of any greate importance, and of Sope and ſpices. Sope was ſold for ſixe or ſeuen ſouls the pound, homely butter, at foure ſouls the pound, and an egge at halfe a patart.</p>
            <p>The fourth of this moneth, the Walons began to mutyne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that Captaine Vemi in executing the lawe, had hanged a Walon in the night: and therfore the ſouldiers of the Lord of Dorein came, and offered their harquebuzes harde to his breſt to the great hazarde of his life: For they woulde needes knowe of him, who was the Authour of this executing of iuſtice: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the vprore was in the ende appeaſed, by reaſon of the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng of another ſouldier that was pryſoner.</p>
            <p>The ſixth of May, the enemie of Fuyke, fiue with ſhot ſixe or ſeuen Cowes of the towne, becauſe they fed neerer them the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were wonted: but in recompence thereof, the Townes men flue three of their ſouldiers withſhot.</p>
            <p>The next day, they which lay in the wood ſalyed out to take the Cowes of the towne, howbeit the Souldiers of the
<pb facs="tcp:11838:97"/>towne kept them ſafe enough from that. This night ſalied out of the little gate of the wood fiue or ſixe ſouldiers, who ſlewe one of the watche.</p>
            <p>The eight of this moneth the enemie ſhot with the greate ordenance, quite through the great Steeple, hard adioyning to the dyke: and the ſame night went foure meſſengers towards the ſhippes, with a conuoye of twentie or thirtie ſhot, which gaue an alarme to the enemie lying in the trenches, as theſe poſts paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, carrying w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> them three olde doues, that ſhould bring anſwere backe againe.</p>
            <p>The nienth of this moneth which was Whitſon eaue, the enemie had caſt a mans head by the Towne walles about the Bulwarke, with this inſcription: this is captaine Oliuer his head. The ſame day were taken and committed towarde ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Quintin and his daughter, and maſter Lambert ſometyme Burroughmaſter of Harlem, becauſe they were ſuſpected of treaſon.</p>
            <p>The next morrowe at foure of the clocke in the afternoone, the enemie iſſued foorth to driue the towne cattle, &amp; draue before them in deene about thirtie kine, but although they which draue them were to the number of 150. yet, eight or tenne ſouldiers of the towne, maugre their heads, recouered them all, from them.</p>
            <p>The 12. of May, about eight of the clocke in the morning, returned one of the flying poſtes, hauing tyed to his legge a litle rounde ſcroule. But the thirteenth of the ſaide moneth there entred all helly naked, one, whome, the enemie had taken vppon the Mere dike. The ſame day in the morning, arriued another flying poſte with a letter, but about foure of the clocke, the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie which lay in the dennes, and in the wood, came downe to driue the kine out of the medowes, that lay before the wood gate, howbeit thirtie ſouldiers comming out of the Towne to ſkirmiſh with them, fruſtrated theyr intent and purpoſe.</p>
            <p>The fourteenth of this moneth, one of the towne mynes ſunke, by reaſon of the enemies continuall vndermining, and great abundance of rayne that fell, ſo that three ſouldiers were ouerwhelmed therein: and therefore, the Towne ſounded the Alarme.</p>
            <pb n="93" facs="tcp:11838:97"/>
            <p>The 15. day the Harlemians ſent another Poſte towardes the ſhippes, with a Canuoye of 30. Harquebuziers, which gaue the enemy ſuch an Alarme, as that hee in the meane while eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped theyr handes.</p>
            <p>The 16. of the ſayd moneth, the Sonldiers of the Towne ſayling out, chaſed the enemy from the trench next to the wood, and hauing flame one of the warde, brought backe with them three Morions and two Harquebuzes. The next morowe one of the Souldiers of Ruſtenbrough Guard, tooke the trenche by Fuyke, carrying backe with him for butin, three pikes &amp; a Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket. The ſame night, the Guard of Ruſtenbrough made an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſion as farre as Iohn Pittamans houſes, where they ſlewe two of the watch, hauing gotten for their paines, three cloakes, one Cuſhin, and a ſarge.</p>
            <p>But the next day the towneſmen kild out of their mine with a ſhotte, a Spanyard, who was eſteemed, a man of ſome reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and credite, becauſe he had a chaine of Gold about his neck. The ſame day the towneſmen blew vp a myne, which coſte the enemy verie deare. The ſame day alſo, commandement was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, that all the earth which was carryed vp to the Rampares, ſhould be caſt ouer the ſaide Rampares, becauſe the enemy laye vnder them, which was very good counſell, by reaſon that the towneſmen thereby, ramforced them aboue two faddomes thick. The ſame day alſo was a proclamation, that euery man, ſhoulde be alowed but one pound of bread the day, women and maydes halfe a pounde, and three children, one pounde: But ſtrum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pettes and Pages to eate nothing els but Graynes. And they that were not able to liue with a pounde of bread, had free liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie giuen them of the ſayd Graynes. For there was not a byt of rye bread left. Neyther might the Brewers brew any beare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue 20. ſouls the barrell.</p>
            <p>The 19. of May, there gotte vp into the towne Bulwarke, foure or fiue of the enemies, and with ſhot, ſlewe three men and a mayde, as ſhe was carrying of earth: whereupon, the Drums ſounded the Alarme. The ſame day, the Souldiers of the towne ſalied out, and drew neare to the wood, where they ſlewe two Souldiers, and brought the third away priſoner. The next mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe, they that laye in the wood, by the Spittle, and in the way
<pb facs="tcp:11838:98"/>which leadeth to the wood, made excurſions, for the driuinge of the Towne cattle, whome the Harlemians ſtayed, and with the loſſe of one ſoldiour, ſlew two men at armes.</p>
            <p>The ſame daye the Townſmen ſente backe a priſoner which was brought in by night, to the Campe of the Enemie, giuing him in his purſe two Harlem half Dollers, a lofe, and a Letter to deliuer to his Captain: the content wherof was this, That hee ſhoulde bee taken or charged, beefore ſuche time as he had eaten that loſe. This warning they gaue him, becauſe he ſhoulde haue no occaſion to complaine, and finde him ſelfe grieued, if euer he were ſurpriſed.</p>
            <p>The 21. of the ſayde moneth, the Enemye hauinge gotten vppe to the Rampars, diſpatched nine Pyoners ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryinge of earth: But the daye following, they ſhotte out of their mortyer peeces eyght bullettes of wylde fier: ſo that the fier caught holde in the kinges ſtreete, at the corner of the Bath ſtreete, but it was forthwith put out.</p>
            <p>The three and twentie of Maye in the After noone, the Enemyes of Fuyke and others, to the number very neere of fiue hundred, had luſtily ſkirmiſhed with our trench, and with the forte of Ruſtenbrough, where, at the firſte, were not aboue eight or tenne ſoldtours, for manye were gotten into the Towne, where the enemie ſo forciblye aſſayled, as that they wanne the firſte trenche on that ſide adioyning euen bard to the bridge of the chiefe forte, where ſome Spaniſhe Lorde, or Captayne of eſtimation, and an other Captaine, not farre from thence were ſlayne, and ſixe or ſeauen other Spaniſhe ſoldiours taken, and ſome of their heades cutte off.</p>
            <p>And the ſame euening, were the heads of two Captaines and two other Spaniardes, ſette vppon long poles, vpon the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:11838:98"/>toppe of the Bullwarke in the viewe of the Enemie, where they ſtoode vntyll the next morowe.</p>
            <p>There were alſo at this ſkirmiſh of the enemies ſide hurt and ſlaine betwixt thirtie and forty, ſome of which they caryed awaye in a ſmal veſſell into their trenches.</p>
            <p>And one of the Captaynes had a chayne of golde about his necke, beeſides two or three hundred crownes about him, whiche was a verye good bootie for the ſoldiours of the town<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But in the retrayt of the enemye, the powder whiche Iohn Scatter the Enſigne had brought thither, was ſette on fier, as hee heide it betwixt his armes: ſo that both hee and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates were ſhrewdlye heate, and ſixe or ſeauen others, ſome of which tooke no harme.</p>
            <p>The foure and twentie of the ſayd Moneth the Enemies beeſette them ſelues in euerye corner, to dryue the Towne Cattell: ſeauen or eyght of whiche they had gotten at theyr commaundemente: But they were ſo worthely purſued, as that the Enemye was fayne to forgoe them, leauinge beehynde them for a pawne, ſixe or ſeauen of their ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours.</p>
            <p>The ſame daye, the Nauyes on the Meere, played one with the other with their great Ordinaunce, but to ſmall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>The fiue and twentie of Maye in the after noone, came in a Doue, or flying Poſte with Letters: In the eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was a great lyght made vppon the loweſt pynacle of the Tower, wherevpon at eleuen of the clocke at nyght, yſſued a great number of people out of the Towne, to aſſyſte thoſe whiche came from our ſhippes with powder.</p>
            <p>All that night the great Ordenounce was heard to ſhoote off very terribly: But the greateſt loſſe fell vppon our owne peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. For they hearing the noyſe of our men which came out of the Town: and ſeeing them, thought verelye they had bene the Enemye, by meane wherof, manye loſt their lyues, and caſt al the powder into the water.
<pb facs="tcp:11838:99"/>This noyſe and crye, and ſhooting off, of the great Ordinaunce, laſted all night long: ſo that the Alarme ſounded in euery cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the towne.</p>
            <p>Neuertheleſſe, the towneſmen brought away with them, two or three priſoners, one of which, by the report of the enemy ſelf, was a Captaine. They like wyſe, whiche accompanyed thoſe that went to the ſhippes, and were bringing of pouder to the towne, ſayde, that in their firſt iſſuing out towardes the ſhippes, they loſt 16. or 20. of their men.</p>
            <p>The 26. of the ſaide moneth, the enemy attempted an other ſkirmiſh, for the driuyng of the towne cattle: howbeit they were wel yuough met with al, for they left there in pawne, a Seriant of a bande, and two or three other Souldiers: and but three of the to wneſmen, onely hurt. At the ſame tyme, one of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey men, from whome the enemy had taken away his Cowe, went to the woode, and there tooke an horſe in exchaunge, and brought him home.</p>
            <p>The 27. of the ſayd moueth, at eight of the clocke at night, the enemy ſet vp a Gallowes on the plat fourme, and hunge vp certayne Citizens and Souldiers whom they had taken the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond night before, when as they thought to haue come into the Towne with the pouder. Some they hunge vp by the necke, and ſome by the feete, which deede, ſo moued our Souldiers, as that they alſo ſet vp a Gallowes on the toppe of the Bulwarke, in the ſight of the enemy, where they hunge vp Maiſter Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hert, Maiſter Quirin, and a Prieſt, Adrian Groenenthuich and the young ladde whiche came from the wood, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng that the latter two were condemned to bee ſcourged and whipped, and the boye beſides, to bee burnte in the face: all whiche, accompanied the other fiue Souldiers that were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the wood: But maiſter Quirin his daughter, and a Walon, that was brought from the wood, were drowned in Backneſſe ditche. Theſe twelue were exeruted without the conſent and leaue eyther of the Magiſtrate or Captaynes. Ouer and beſides, they had taken the ſame night, Sir Iaſper and Sir Reynold Roothoofte, Doctor Elſen, and the Preacher of the Spittle.</p>
            <p>The 28. of May, the enemy comming with 63. ſhips, fought
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:11838:99"/>on Harlem Mere, with the Princes ſhippes, and put them to flight, with the loſſe of 21. veſſels, on whiche victory, the enemy had the night before, greatly tryumphed. The ſame day, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy aſſailed the forte whiche ſtoode vpon the ſide of the mere: where they were thriſe brauely repulſed: howbeit when they of the forte ſaw, that the ſhippes had forſaken them, and lefte them without eyther victuall, Munition or pouder, they rendred vp the Peece, with the ſafetie of their liues and goods.</p>
            <p>The 30. of May, the enemy blewe vp a Mine, ſo that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, three of the towne were ſlayne, and Captayne Vemi, with Cochim, were in great hazard of their liues. Then ſounded the Alarme: and Captaine Vemi, who was as it were buried with the earth, was by the help of the pyoners recouered, and another Souldier with him. And another Souldier that was caſte be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponde the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>leftblank; returned to the towne by reaſon of the ſmoke, without any hurt, &amp; yet he was ſaluted with many a ſhot.</p>
            <p>The firſt of Iune, the enemy againe, hunge vp vpon theyr platfourme, tenne or eleuen men. And the next morow, iſſued out of the towne 40. ſhot, to ſee if they could find out them which laye in the wood, but perceiuing the number of the enemy to be ouer many for them to deale withall, they retyred, without exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting that their enterpriſe.</p>
            <p>The third of this moneth, the enemy had mounted a faire ſquare Cage, faſt tyed with cordes, to the toppe of foure ſhippe Maſtes: all open both aboue and behinde, and full of holes, out of which, the Harquebuziers might ſhoote: howbeit they had not ſhotte aboue twiſe, but that the towneſmen, had ſo beaten their cordes wherewith it was bounde, as that it hunge all on the one ſide, and the reſt fell from the toppe to the ground, and two or three of the enemies with all, making therewith an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible ſhoote, by reaſon they fell from ſuch an heigth: At y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame tyme, a Citizen, and two meſſengers more were ſent to the Prince, carrying with them certaine Doues for the bringyng backe of letters.</p>
            <p>The 4. of Iune, the enemy cauſed the towneſmen to fallie out of the Bulwarke, whereupon, it coſt ſixe of them their liues: And the next day, commaundement was giuen, that the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, ſhould eate nothing els but Graynes, howbeit, it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb facs="tcp:11838:100"/>for the ſouldiours to eate wheate bread as they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>The ſeauenth of the ſayde moneth, the Towneſmen founde a Mine of nine faddomes deepe, dygged vnder ſainte Iohns Bulwarke, to bee blowne vp: where they founde a dead man, a Moryon, and a white lofe:, But the eigh day, came in a Doue ſente from the Lorde of Batenbrough, by whome hee wrote, that hee much merueyled, that they had not receyued Letters, by thoſe Doues which came before from him, and that the Prince woulde ſhortlye ſende them ayde, which was but a colde comfort to the poore Citizens.</p>
            <p>The nienth of the ſame moneth, the Townſmen gaue the Enemie a breakefaſte from out of the Wood-Gate, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſayde, that they had neyther bread nor beere in the Towne.</p>
            <p>The tenth of Iune were ſixe of the Sworne men cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, for the continuall looking to, and vnderſtanding of the Letters ſent by the Poſtes in the ayre: beecauſe the Citizens were not well pleaſed, that that buſineſſe was ſo ſlenderly loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vnto. The ſame day were killed with a Cannon ſhot, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Iohnſon the carpenter, Simon Score, and two young chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
            <p>This daye the Enemye blewe vppe a myne: howbeit there was no hurte done: But yet through the fauour of the Smoke, the Townſmen wanne alſo an other mine of them.</p>
            <p>The eleuenth of this Moneth the Deane of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of Harlem, and manye other Citizens beeing in the Campe of the Enemye, deſired to come to a parle with the Towneſmen, but they woulde none of that, they thanked them.</p>
            <p>Howbeit the nexte morrowe, the Enemies came in great
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:11838:100"/>number out of the wood, to take the Towne kine, but after that they had loſte eyght ſouldiours, and wee one, they rety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
            <p>The ſame daye, in the after noone the Enemy retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for the execution of the ſayde enterpryſe: But hauinge gotten ſixe of the kyne within their poſſeſſion, ſixe of the Towne ſouldiours ſo played with them, as that they recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them agayne from them, whiche dealing draue the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie into ſuch a rage, as that they left playing with the ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, and ſhot at the kine.</p>
            <p>The ſame daye alſo came a Walon from Ruſtenbrough to parle with the Chaptayne, howbeit be refuſed it.</p>
            <p>The thirteenth of the ſayde Moneth, there came flying to the Towne two Doues without Letters: in which daye the Towne ſouldiours had gotten a myne guarded by the Spaniardes, three of which were ſlayne, and the reſt full of lyfe in the heeles, ſaued them ſelues.</p>
            <p>The ſame daye, the Magiſtrate cauſed certaine peeces of ſiluer to bee coyned of tenne and twentye Souls a peece: howbeit they were not worth aboue the one halfe, in ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.</p>
            <p>The 15. of Iune the Enemie ſhewed him ſelfe readye on all handes to giue the aſſaulte: and through the bloweing vp of a myne there were hoyſed vp into the ayre, betweene thirtie and fortie ſouldiours of the Town, and not one of them ſlaine.</p>
            <p>And eftſoones, whiles the ſmoake laſted, the Enemie with tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gettes mounted vp luſtely to giue the aſſaulte: but when they ſee the Towneſmen ready to receyue them, they forth with made their retraite.</p>
            <p>The nexte morowe there came in a Doue, whiche Doue, as it ſeemed had eſcaped from out of the hands of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie.
<pb facs="tcp:11838:101"/>The ſame day, the enimſe had againe ſet vpp a little houſe faſte pinned to the toppes of foure ſhippe maſtes, where into, they both went in, and came out behinde.</p>
            <p>The 17. day of the ſame moneth, M. Serrats, and M. Gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, were ſent in a conuoy of many ſhotte, towardes Fuyke, to aduertiſe the Prince of euery thing, and caryed with them cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine Doues in a baſket, giuing knowledge by the making of a fier, of their ſafe paſſage.</p>
            <p>The next morrow M. Serrats, ſent one of the Doues with Letters, the contents wherof were theſe, that the Prince of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range was at Leyden, that the Lorde of Batenbroughe, laye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Vtright and Amſterdame, to cut them from victualles, and that him ſelfe, would ſet forward the matter as much as was poſſible for him to doe. In this meane while, they beeganne to caſt a new Rampare and ditch within the Towne, all alongſt from Sainte Margarettes vnto Sainte Iohns Gate, and fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed it. There was alſo at that tyme great miſerye in the Towne: for then they beganne to eate horſes, and cowe hydes.</p>
            <p>The 19. of the ſayde moneth, came in another of the ſayde Doues with the Princes Letters, written from Leyden, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentes whereof were theſe, that he much merueiled, that hee had not had any poſte ſent vnto him from the towne in al that while, ſeeing hee had ſent poſtes thither both by water and by lande, which neuer came into Harlem.</p>
            <p>The 22. of Iune there came from the wood, a Lieutenaunt or ſome other Officer, requiring to haue anſwer of his meſſage, which he had. And the 24, which was ſaint Iohns day, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned a Doue with Letters from the Prince, That his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie would ſhortly ayde them, and at that time was none other meate to be had in the Towne, but horſe fleſh, cattes, bread made of nauettes and of <hi>chanure</hi> ſeede.</p>
            <p>The 25. of the ſame moneth, the Townſmen ſhotte from a Courtin, twiſe or thriſe through the little houſe that was pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the foure Maſtes: and in the Euening, a walon ſhot, came from Fuyke, about the rendring vp Ruſtenbrough, and from thence wente to the Towne.</p>
            <p>The 27. of the ſayde moneth at night, a Camyſado of about
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:11838:101"/>fiue or ſix hundred men was made to goe to Fuike, hoping to be ayded by the Princes ſhips, but all in daiue, and therfore they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned without doing of any thing.</p>
            <p>The 28 of Iune, at fiue of the clock in the morning, arryued an other flying poſt, with Letters of comfort to the Townſmen: And the night folowing was another camyſado of aboue a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men made, to go to Fuyke, howebeit the enterpriſe tooke none effect, becauſe the ſhips holpe them no whit, which greatly diſcouraged the townſmen. Theſe two nights, the enemy gaue the Alarme in many places of the cowne.</p>
            <p>The 29. was a proclamation made, that the townſmen ſhould ſhew to the deputies therto appoynted, al their victuals, becauſe the ſoldiours vnder the colour of ſearching for them, robbed and ſpoyled the common people. The next morow returned a poſte of the ayre, with two letters, wherat al the town reioyced, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the good newes conteined in them.</p>
            <p>The 1. of Iuly at 11. of the clock in the foren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For after theſe 2. Captaines had had ech of them their ſafe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct graunted, they came to a parle together. Afterwarde came the Count Ouerſtein accompanied with foure others, and when ſafeconduct was graunted on eyther ſide, the Burroughmaiſter Iohn Fliet, captaine Steinbach, Roſoni, and Pellican, had an houres conference with him, betweene the little Wood gate, and the Water gate, deliberating three times together one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother before they left: &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> very curteouſly tooke their leaues.</p>
            <p>About foure of the clock in the afternoone, a Walon page of an 18. or 19. yeares old, came running from the trench of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie towards the Town, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our ſouldiours brought through Scaelwyke gate into the Towne: whoe ſayd that they wanted victualles in the Campe, and ſo did they alſo in the towne. The nexte morowe, the Enemyes planted all the great ordenaunce
<pb facs="tcp:11838:102"/>they had any where, in the trenches before the Towne, and ſo battered Pyntoren, and Raueſtein, as that the Towre and the wall fell to the ground: they ſhot alſo through many houſes, &amp; ouerthrew great ſtore of them: howbeit through a violent Eaſte winde, the little houſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was faſt pinned to the foure maſts ends &amp; ſet vpon the platforme, was blowne downe: Thus, that which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great Ordenance could not beat down, was by God hisgrace ouerthrown by the wind. In the afternoon, was the towre neere to S. Ratherins bridge beat down and deſtroyed. The ſame day was the Enemy ſet in order, to haue giuen the aſſault, wherupon the bell ſounded to the Alarme, howbeit nothing enſued therof. At night the Enemy had brought to the ditches two bridges, for their better &amp; more eaſie giuing of the aſſault: but whils y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſtil waited for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they flew 20. of the Enemies ſouldiers. The ſame day had the Townſmen ſet vpon the Towre, a blacke flagge, letting the ſhippes therby vnderſtand of their miſerable diſtreſſe.</p>
            <p>The 3. of Iuly, the Enemy merueilouſly beat the Towne with canon ſhot: howbeit about 5. of the clock in the afternoone, the townſmen once more parled with the Enemy, at the place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid. The next morow, they againe ſet vp the black flag, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Tower, to ſignifie vnto the ſhips their great penurye &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe. The ſame day returned one of the flying poſtes with let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from the Prince, aduertiſing them, that hee meant the night following to victuall them. The ſame night, al the ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the Towne iſſued out at Scaelwike gate in a Camiſado, looking ettery houre when the ſhippss ſhould ſet their men on land, for the ayding and relieuing of the Towne, but it was al in vaine. The next day the Townſmen parled againe with the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, to wit, 6. on either ſide, where was the Count Boſſu, &amp; the Count Ouerſtein, &amp; foure others on the Enemies behalfe, and Steinbach, Iohn Fliet, Roſoni, Sohey, Pellican, and Corneli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Mathew, on the behalf of the Towne: but they could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. For the ſouldiers would at no hand depart the town with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their armour and weapon.</p>
            <p>The 5. of Iuly at noone, the Princes ſhips ſhewed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> townſmen: wherupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the citize<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; a great number of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers ſalied out of the town to aſſiſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which thing the Enemy

The 6. of that month, was a white flagg ſet vpon the Tower, and they alſo ſent by plaine force in a ſmal veſſell, acap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the Towne named Nycholas Barnard, to the Prince of Orenge his ſhippes, carrying with him foure Doues, and a Letter to the Prince of Orenge, aduertiſing, and praying him that he would ſend victuals by the Barques, becauſe they were no longer able to abyde the famine.</p>
            <p>The 7. of the ſaid month came a letter fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prince of Oreng ſubſigned alſo by the laſt poſt: praying the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue patience for a day or two, &amp; he would, by the helpe of God, rayſe the camp of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Enemy. Which newes greatly reioyced the citizens &amp; ſoldiers of the Town: albeit euery man before, was ready to haue quite and cleane forſaken it: for many of them had giuen away their goodes and apparel to them that would take them, and beſides, the ſouldieres ſpoyled ſome of them, of al they had: inſomuch, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was a lamentable caſe, to ſee y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miſery wherin they were.</p>
            <p>The ſame day alſo the ſouldiers forcibly ſet vpon a lombard or vſerers houſe, and tooke away all the goodes he had, for they looked euery houre when they ſhould leaue the Towne.</p>
            <p>The 8. of Iuly returned a flying poſte with letters from the Prince, conteining, that he truſted the night following to ayde y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Towne, &amp; that his ſhips ſhoulde giue a falſe Alarme to Fuyke: howbeit the whole force lighted vpon them which lay in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wood, which newes wakned the geateſt part of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> town, &amp; aboue 2000. ſouldiours &amp; citizens watting &amp; looking for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, had put on whit ſhirts to giue them the camiſado, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they might therby helpe the reſt: which enterpriſe as then tooke not effect, which greatly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited the townſinen, ſeeing, that what by reaſon of famyne, and want of victuals they were wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derfully weakned. The ſame night y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> princes ſhips gaue a falſe alarm to Fuyke, ſhooting off their great ordenance, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out doing of any thing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> auayled. Ther was at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time ſo great a famin in Harle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> many died of ho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger.</p>
            <p>The 9. of Iuly came in a flying poſte, bringing newes that the Princes people were diſcomfited at Mannepat: whereupon
<pb facs="tcp:11838:103"/>certaine captaines were of the opinion, that the beſt way was for euery man to prepare him ſelfe to be gone, and leaue the town with the women and children onely in it, but yet they did not ſo: for when the women vnderſtood, that they meant to leaue them and then chldren in the towne, they forthwith ſo diſorderly rann about, weeping &amp; crying, as that no good courſe could be taken therin. The 10. of the ſaid month, the ſoldiours of the towne prepared them ſelues once againe to forſake the towne: And for the making of the way ſure, they firſt appointed ſeuen Euſignes for the vauntguard, the very body and ſtrength wherof, ſhould be altogether ſhot: next to it, ſhould the magiſtrate, the ſwornmen, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> citizens with their wiues &amp; children folow: &amp; for the rerewarde, they appoynted nine other Enſignes. Howbeit this enterpryſe tooke no effect, by reaſon of a letter which came fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the enemy in the wood, containing, that as many as were in the towne ſhould be receiued to mercy, wherupon the Almain captains &amp; ſoldiers giuing credit therunto, this deuice imediatly ceaſed. The ſame day y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Spaniards in toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of victory had placed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their bulwark y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 9. enſignes which they had the day before wonne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> princes people. The 11. of Iuly in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> euening 4. or 5. Enſignes of walons al ſhot, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded to go out at Scaelwik gate, &amp; in deede y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greater number of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were already gotten out, with many citizens and ſwornmen, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there was ſcarſe any man left to defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> breach, which was a difordered &amp; confuſed kinde of dealing: but becauſe ther were none of thoſe ready at hand, which had charg of the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down of the bridges, euery man retyred with great trouble and anoye between the citizens and ſoldiours in euery quarter. And ſurely, if God of his eſpeciall grace had not miraculouſlye kept the town, the enemy might eaſily haue ſurpriſed it: for ther was not a ſoldiour left at the breach, betwixt 11. &amp; 12. of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> clock at midnight. The ſame day the Towneſmen wrote an anſwere to the Enemie, in ſuch ſorte, as that the meſſenger went, and came backe, twiſe. In which day, the ſoldiours had moſt cruelly murdered M. Quintin his daughter, and the ſexten his wife of the Church, which may be an example for all ſuch as think to do the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues good by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miſery of their neighbours &amp; felow citize<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</p>
            <p>The 12. of the ſaid month in the euening, Steinbach, Roſoni, Chriſtofer Vader &amp; 2. Burroughmaiſters, agreed with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enemy
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:11838:103"/>to render the towne vpon compoſition: howbeit this compoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no whit pleaſed <hi>Roſoni,</hi> and therefore he foorthwith aduertiſed the other Walo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> captaynes, who immediatly oppoſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues againſt it, and pulling vp the draw bridge, woulde not ſuffer the perſons aforeſayde come in: neuertheleſſe, at laſt they came in, greatly encouraging y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> citizens &amp; ſouldiers, ſaying, that Don <hi>Fredericke</hi> would ſhew them greater fauour, then they eyther hoped, or yet looked for.</p>
            <p>The 13. of the ſaid moneth, Proclamation was made by the ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of the drum, that al the companies ſhuld aſſemble the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues at a certaine place, where they were aſked whether they would tarry in the towne with the fauour or diſfauour of the Duke of <hi>Alua,</hi> or els depart without armour and weapon: wherupon, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere was made, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they had rather abide in the towne, &amp; ſtand at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> curteſie of the ſaid duke, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to depart without armour &amp; wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon: &amp; beſides, the Scots &amp; Eaſterlings were let to vnderſtande, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were receiued into fauour: wherefore the reſt of the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers commending the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to the mercy of God, waited to ſee what wold become of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

The fift of the ſaid moneth, the Alkemerans iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuyng out of the towne, tooke from the enemie a great barke laden with ſpoyle, and the enemie burnt Coedike.</p>
            <p>The ſixth of this moneth, the enemie forſooke certaine Forts or trenches, which the townes men ſacked, and brought the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin to Alkemer. And the eight day, the enemie ſet fyre on an houſe ſtanding neere a myll, called the Rint myll, and ſo tooke Outdorpway, and from thence to Bergue.

            <p>The tenth of October in the afternoone, the enemie forſooke theyr principall quarter and trenches, whiche was neere to the newe gate, whome the Citizens purſued euen to Heylos and Coſtell, greatly annoying them, and beſides brought backe with them to the towne good ſtore of butin.

<pb facs="tcp:11838:107"/>firſt encounter, the victorie ſeemed to leane to the Count Boſſu his parte, yet the North Hollenders, by reaſon of a new ſtrength wherewith they were ſupplyed, had the victorie: For when they had encompaſſed the Admyral, they without ceaſing, ſo plyed the Spaniardes with balles of vuſlaked lyme, as that they coulde not tell where to beſtowe themſelues: and in the meane time, the reſt ſo luſtily aſſayled the enemie, as that they were dryuen to yeelde vpon compoſition, whereupon the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niardes were determined to haue ſet all theyr powder on fire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they feared to finde no mercy at the North Hollenders hands: w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> thing when the reſt of the ſhips ſaw, they packt on all their ſayles, and made towards Amſterdam, ſaue onely captaine Feſten his ſhip whiche was ſuncke with a Canon ſhot.

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the townes of the North Holland, to wit, Anchuſen, and Horne, are worthie all commendation for euer for their valiant and renowmed actes in the defence of their countrie.</p>

            <p>Whiles the Duke of Alua his deuiſe &amp; purpoſe was thus made voyde as well by the diſhonorable retyre of his ſonne Don Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dericke from Alkmer, as alſo by reaſon of Count Boſſu his loſſe at Sea, ſo that, it ſeemed that the worlde went not on their ſide: Newes were carryed by poſte into Spaine, that the Duke of Alua through his tyrannie, and obſtinate demanding of the tenth pennie,

            <p>When the Duke of Alua was called home into Spaine,

And firſt to beginne with all, The Duke of Alua hauing ſeene that the taking of Mons in Haynault, the wonderfull departure of Count Lodwyke of Naſſou, with the mightines and ſtrength of his armie, and the horrible murder at Paris, had made readie ſo open a way for his blooddy tyrannie: hee like vnto a ſeconde Antiochus, full of all pride and arrogancie, purſued his victorie, and to beginne withall, hee in October, firſt ſacked the Towne of Malines. After that, becauſe hee woulde ſhewe his furie and inſatiable erueltie, hee the ſixteenth of Nouember cauſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue fiue hundred men and women to bee murdered, hanged, headed, and drowned, at the Towne of Zurphen: and within a whyle after, hee committed another farre more cruell and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible ſlaughter at the Towne of Narden, where hee ſlue as it were all the whole Towne, after hee had made them manie faire promiſes, and bereft them of theyr armour and weapon, purſuyng afterwarde with tyrannie the Townes of Hollande.
<pb facs="tcp:11838:109"/>Howbeit the Almightie God, whoſe mercy is alwayes moſt ſeene in the time of neceſſitie, toke them into his protection, my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly ſending vnto them the Prince of Orange, as a ſecond Iudas Machabeus, to reſiſt the blooddie tyrant.</p>
            <p>Nowe it is well enough knowen by the Stories whiche haue gone before, what the bridge was, ouer which he entered into the garden of Holland, before the citie of Harlem, for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of his curſed murders, here before largely enough ſet downe, after it had abidden the ſiege for the ſpace of eight mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths: where Don Fredericke, the ſaide Duke his ſonne, was generall of the campe, who followed the fathers owne naturall inclination (hauing for all that loſt at that ſiege, aboue twelue thouſand men, through the valtantiſe of the Harlemians) after that the towne was rendred vnto him, through the diſcomfiture of the princes armie, and extremitie of the famine, cauſed aboue two thouſand three hundred ſouldiers to be executed by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſword, halter, and the water, who valiantly had defended this towne: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, that the Gentle Reader may manifeſtly conſider, that at that time, the Hollanders were euen vp to the chinne in the water, readie to be drowned, and ſincke to the grounde. For, through the loſſe of Harlem, Alkemer, and Leyden, they were all in great danger. Howbeit, the Lord God, who commonly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuereth his from oppreſſion, depriued the Spaniards of their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable vnderſtanding, when as through their mutinie they leaft purſuing of their victorie: which cauſed the Hollanders to take courage againe vnto them, fortified their townes, and by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon accorde agreed to abide &amp; ſuſteine a defenſiue warre, for the defending of their wiues &amp; children, and to hazarde their bodies and goods, for the benefit and welfare of their countrie. Which in very deede cleerely appeared by them of Leyden, who, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the right cuſtome of warres, burnt and pulled downe halfe a myle about the towne, all the houſes, caſtles, villages, monaſteries, and trees, thereby to fortifie their towne, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the enemie. And ſo likewiſe had the Alkemerians done.</p>
            <p>And to ſpeake the truth, the yeelding vp of Harlem, was a great loſſe to the Hollanders: but on the other ſide, whoſoeuer will conſider and weigh, what townes and fortreſſes of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:11838:109"/>the Lorde God hath giuen &amp; deliuered vp vnto them, ſhall find, that their conqueſt hath byn greater then their loſſe. For, they conquered the caſtle of the <hi>Rammekens</hi> in Zelande, called <hi>Zeabrough,</hi> wherby, they not only became maiſters ouer all Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, but obtained the key of the Sea, and of all the low countries. And ſhortly after, the L. <hi>Lewys</hi> of <hi>Boyſet,</hi> Admyral of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> quarter of the ſea for the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> wanne a iolly victory againſt the armie by Sea, which was ſet foorth of <hi>Antwerpe:</hi> where tenne of the greateſt ſhips with the Admirall of the enemy were taken, beſides thoſe that were ſounke, and the ſouldiers which were caſt ouer the boord, ſaue only their Captaine <hi>Iulian Rome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> who ſaued himſelfe by ſwimming, where they loſt aboue 1500, of their beſt Souldiers, as well Spanyardes as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>The iolly victory likewiſe in North <hi>Hollande,</hi> which the valiannt Captayne <hi>Nicholas Ruychauer</hi> of <hi>Harlem</hi> had againſt the Armye of <hi>Amſterdam:</hi> where were taken Priſoners the Count of <hi>Boſſue,</hi> and with him many moe aſwel Spaniards as others, that were in the Admyrall, whiche they thought inuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible.</p>
            <p>I will here for this time paſſe ouer the ſiege of <hi>Alkmer,</hi> and the ſhameful retraite of <hi>Don Fredericke,</hi> after he had giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 7. aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaultes. And alſo the Duke of <hi>Alua</hi> his retrayte into Spaine: and howe, to his ſhame, the proud Image which ſtood in the Caſtle of <hi>Antwerpe,</hi> was deſtroyed and carried away. Beſides the Arryuall of the greate Commendator of <hi>Caſtile, Don Lew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ys de Requeſens,</hi> and the ſeconde battell that was fought at Sea. And to make an ende, I leaue to the Hiſtoriographers, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſurpryſing of the Towne of <hi>Gertrudenberge</hi> and manye other ſkyrmiſhes, and thinges, becauſe I woulde returne to the ſaid ſiege of <hi>Leyden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Towne of <hi>Leyden</hi> then, was for the firſt time, beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from the laſt of October 1573. vnto the 21. of Marche 74. For at that tyme the ſiege was rayſed, by reaſon of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming downe of Count <hi>Lodwyke</hi> of <hi>Naſſou</hi> into the low countries: ſo that as then, <hi>Holland</hi> was as it were, quite ridde of al ſouldiers. For the famous P. of <hi>Orange</hi> came with his army to <hi>Gouic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que</hi> by <hi>Bommel,</hi> whenas the great commendator laye not farre
<pb facs="tcp:11838:110"/>off with his. The principall cauſe, why the Prince of Orange pitched his campe there was, for that his brother Counte Lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyke had written vnto him, from about Maſtright, that he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the next morrowe to depart from thence with his armie, and woulde bee at Herwerd, betwene the Rhine and the Maze, by reaſon hee meant there to ſet ouer his horſe men, and ioyne with his brother, and therefore requyred the Prince his brother to come and meete him with his men, Shippes, Barques, and Bridges. And although this aduerciſement nothing pleaſed his brother, ſeeing that by reaſon of the ſhortnes of the time, it was impoſſible to ſend into the riuer, theſe warlike preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and furniture, yet came he with his armie, to the place afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaide, vſing theſe or ſuch like ſpeeches: although the comming of my brother is a thing whiche I like well of, yet I woulde he were an hundred myles off with his armie. For, his Excellencie knewe right well, that his comming coulde not bee without great danger, as the iſſue thereof in the end, cleerely ſhewed. Howbeit, as afore hath been ſaide, this holpe the Leydens well.</p>
            <p>The Commendator aforeſaide, who after the victorie at Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker head, againſt Duke Chriſtopher of Bauier, the Count Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine his ſonne, Count Lodwike, and Count Henrie his brother, ſeemed to bee very quiet and ſtill, was not for all that ydle with his councell at Bruxels, but had conceiued in his head three en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerpriſes. The firſt was, to ſubdue North Hollande: The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde, to make himſelfe maſter of the Maze: and the thirde, once againe to beſiege Leyden, for hee was throughly informed by the Popiſh fugitiues, and others their fautors which were in the towne: that they had neither garniſon, nor yet corne, &amp; that the villages were bare, by reaſon of the continuall foreſtalling of certaine ill willers.</p>
            <p>Nowe, all the worlde knoweth, what good ſucceſſe the firſie enterpriſe which hee tooke in hande againſt the North Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders had, for he loſt at it aboue two thouſand ſouldiers. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſucceſſe of his Antwerp armie (which ſhould haue made him maſter of the Maze) before Lillo, is at large ſet foorth by the dead and drowned ſouldiers, and the Ships which were brought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>to Zealande, and the taking of the vice Admirall, Adolf of Hamſteed. There reſteth now no more but the third enterpriſe,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:11838:110"/>which is the ſiege of Leyden.</p>
            <p>The twentie and ſixe of May, at two of the clock in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, there came before this Towne, Frauncis Baldez with an armie, betweene ſeuen and eight thouſand men, both of Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes, Walons, and Almaines. His firſt arryuall was from Amſterdam, by Harlem Mere, with ſhips, Caruelles, &amp; Barkes laden with men and victuals, harde to Leyerdory bridge, where they ſtroke ſayle. And about midnight, there iſſued out of the Towne a certaine Captaine, named, maſter Andrew with thirtie ſouldiers, who falling into the Spaniardes handes, was carried away with a ſhot, dead, before the Towne. Howbeit the Citizens got him vp, and carryed him to the Towne, and there honorably buried him: neuertheleſſe they leaft in his place a dead Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, whome they had taken priſoner.</p>
            <p>As the enemie was arriued at Leyden, they began againe to make their firſt trenches &amp; bulwarks, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> citizens which were vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Rampares, began about the day breake to march with two or three Enſignes of ſouldiers towards Zoeterwood, part of which tarryed ſtill at the ſaid place, and the reſt went to the Trenche, or Fort of Leyderdam, which Fort through the negligence of the Townes men was whole and ſounde. The Leydens, ſent meſſengers to Hay, Delft, Roterodam, and Dortright, where at that preſent was arryued the Prince of Orange, hauing rayſed his campe about Bommell, to the ende hee might preuent and ſtoppe the enemie. But the valiant Captaine Ruychauer which was at Hay, receiued the newes ſomewhat too late: and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe, through his induſtrie and diligence he did ſo muche, as that, what by reaſon of the Trenches and Skyrmiſhes at the Spirite bridge, they of the religion whiche were in Haye, ſaued the greater part of their moueables, although the Papiſts came y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> day in the euening, not only to Hay, but alſo to Leyderda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
            </p>
            <p>But when the reſt of Baldez armie a fewe dayes after ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryued in two companies: the one from Vtright towardes Goude ſluſe, and Alſen: and the other from Harlem, by North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyke to Falkebrough, at which places the Princes people had two fortes, and at euery fort fiue hundred Engliſh men, vnder the conduct of Edward Cheſter, the ſaide Engliſhe men abode the firſt Shocque or charge.
<pb facs="tcp:11838:111"/>For Goude ſluſe was hoatly aſſayled by the Papiſtes that came from Vtright, howbeit the Engliſhmen luſtily repulſed them to their great ſhame and loſſe, and that by the valiancie of Captaine Genforde an Engliſh man. But becauſe the horſemen, had none other way to come into Holland, but by theſe forces, they were inforced by very luſtie hand ſtrokes ſo to continue the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault,
<note place="margin">The Engliſhe men driuen out of their fort</note> as that the Engliſhmen were driuen of neceſſitie to forſake the ſaide fort: which had not beene ſo lightly done, if their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions at Alſen, which is but halfe a myle thence, had done their dueties aſwell as they which were in the ſaid fort: for as they were comming to aide them, the fort was alreadie wonne: wherefore they all fled at once.</p>
            <p>To be ſhort, the Spaniard payed dearely for this victorie, for it cauſed many wagons laden with dead bodies to bee brought thither. In this maner then, the 27. of May, ioyned in part the firſt troupe that came from Vtright, to the campe of Baldez at Leyerthorpe &amp; the reſt paſſing the linkes went to Hay.</p>
            <p>The thirde troupe alſo paſſing the twentie &amp; ſeuen of May by Northwyke, arryued before the great fort which was not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly finiſhed: But the fiue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panies of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Engliſhmen had forſaken it before they ſawe the enemie: although they had the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, requyred the Leydens of certaine horſemen, to diſcouer the enemie, whome, as they ſaide, they had not as yet perceiued and ſeene: albeit they had drawne themſelues neere to Waddyng, where the Spaniarde preſſing harde vppon them, gaue them the ſkirmiſhe, whiche ſkirmiſhe, the Citizens ſaw as they ſtood vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Rampares, and beſides, they neuer ſaw either on the ſide, or yet on the other, any man fall downe dead, although they had beaten one another with ſhot along time together, which dealing the Citizens greatly ſuſpected.</p>
            <p>When this falſe ſkirmiſh was finiſhed, the Engliſhe men approched neerer the towne, to wit, betweene the Citizens Trenche that ranne betweene Boſhouſe bridge and the towne: ſo that the Captaine and certaine with him, came into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Towne, making this contract with the Citizens, That when the ſaide Captaine ſhoulde ſee himſelfe and his put to the worſe by the Spaniardes, that they ſhould then retyre vnder Hay gate, where the greateſt parte of the great ordenance was planted: But
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:11838:111"/>ſo ſoone as they ſhoulde ſee the Enſigne taken from the gate, that both he and his ſhoulde drawe towardes the ſide, for then they meant to diſcharge all the great ordenance vppon the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.</p>
            <p>But time ſhewed that this concluſion no whit liked the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh men. For they were no ſooner out of the Towne, but that they marched towards the enemie with enſigne diſplaide, where they were vpon a certaine condition reuerently receiued. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit an harder matter befell them immediatly after, for they had not beene there very long, but that they were commanded to put out theyr matches, and the horſemen that came from Forſcote, drane them before in chaſe vpon the Spaniardes: whiche thing certaine of them to the number of thyrtie two, or thirtie and three ſeeing, amongeſt whome were certaine officers both Engliſhe, &amp; Flemiſh, retyred themſelues againe vnder the towne, who not long after got into it.</p>
            <p>The reſt were had to Falkebrough, where theyr armour and weapon were taken from them before Torenfleete houſe, and the next morowe being vncaſed of their gallant apparrell, were carried to Harlem, where, ſom of them were put to be Pyoners, and ſome of them paſſing through Flanders, returned into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
            <p>But heere I am not to forget one thing, that ſome of theſe ſouldiers which coulde not tell by what meanes to get into the Towne, choſe rather to leape from the ſcluſe into the water, and ſo drowne themſelues, then ſo vilanouſly fall into the handes of the enemie.</p>
            <p>By this meane then was the towne of Leyden, in foure or fiue quarters beſieged, and the enemie had built round about it, ſixtie and two fortes. When Leyden was nowe in this eſtate, the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens had foorth with aducrtiſed his Excellencie lying at Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dright of the matter. Howbeit, the Prince hauing aduertiſement heereof, before theyr letters came to his handes, ſate in councell with the deputies of the Eſtates of Hollande, which were there preſent, and ſo the 27. of May, wrote to the Leydens as follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth.</p>
            <p>His Excellencie hauing delibered with the Eſtates aforeſaid thought it moſt expedient, That Colonnell Cheſter, who was
<pb facs="tcp:11838:112"/>at Falk brough with 600. ſouldiers, or there about, ſhoulde, if it were poſſible, enter into Leyden, which by that meane mighte take away all hope &amp; occaſion, either of the beſieging or aſſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of it any longer.</p>
            <p>Ouer and beſides, that the Magiſtrate ſhoulde cauſe all the beggers and impotent perſons to depart the Towne, which might rather trouble then ayde them in theyr diſtreſſe.
<note place="margin">His excellencies aduiſe to the Leydens.</note> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, to take ſuch order for the ſparing deliuerie of their victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alles, as that they might ſerue them for 3. mone<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hes: exhorting them of himſelfe, that they would valiantly behaue themſelues as hee fully and wholy truſted they woulde: and in the meane whyle, that his Excellencie, and the Eſtates woulde not forget to ſeeke by all meanes poſſible, theyr ayde and deliuerance from the enemie.</p>
            <p>And although y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this could not ſo ſoone be brought to paſſe as they wiſhed, yet not to be thereby diſcouraged, but rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly perſiſt in a ſhort trouble and diſtreſſe, then yeeld them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to an euerlaſting thraldome and miſery. And to that ende hee would haue them conſult and take aduiſe together, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetely and wiſely weighing, if they could in ſo needfull a caſe, to withſtand the time of the ſaide three monethes, for feare of falling into the miſchiefe and miſerie of the Harlemians, and if ſo be they were able to withſtand the ſaid three monethes, that then they ſhould giue two nights enſuing at midnight, a ſigne with fire, to the ende the anſwere might not come to the enemies hands.</p>
            <p>The day before that they receiued this anſwere, The Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens had alreadie made proclamation, that all the women, chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and ſtrangers paſſengers ſhould get them out of the town. And Butter, Mylke, Fleſh, Bread, &amp; ſuch like neceſſary thinges were ſet at a reaſonable price. The Brewers alſo were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to brewe any beere aboue twenty and fiue ſouls y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> barrel, which thing, alas, was euill obſerued. The 30. of May they anſwered the ſaid letters, much like as followeth: That as for Colonell Cheſter and his ſouldiers,
<note place="margin">The anſwer of the Leydens to his excellency.</note> that the matter ſtood in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtate, as they had written to his Excellencie in their former letters which were intercepted.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:11838:112"/>And as for their victuals, there ſhoulde bee no fault in them, but that they would ſtretch them out to the vttermoſt, neither would they ſuffer any vnprofitable perſon conſume them if it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for them to doe it. Howbeit that they were not able to abide to tarrie ſo long: notwithſtanding, that they would write to him hereof more at large, &amp; in the meane while repoſe all their truſt and confidence for their deliuerance, in the aſſiſtance of God, his Excellencie, and their fellow brethren, &amp; confederates. In that they would not giue any tokens with fire, was becauſe the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie ſhould not thereby any way ſuſpect their extreeme neceſſity, and ſo the rather more ſtrictly incloſe them, &amp; thereby ſtop thoſe wayes which are now free and at libertie for their meſſengers to paſſe. And beſides, they ſent for pouder, and wrote that they were reaſonably well determined to keepe the Towne, and therefore would put their Citizens in pay.</p>
            <p>They ſent alſo vnto his Excellencie, the copie of certaine letters which the enemie had written vnto them, by which they vnderſtood that the enemie had ſmall hope of going forward in forcible maner. Laſt of all, they moſt humbly beſought his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie to haue a fatherly care of them, as their truſt was in him, and haſten their deliuerance, but yet not ſo, as that the ouer haſt therein might breake the necke thereof.</p>
            <p>The Prince of Orange being greatly troubled for the town of Leyden, becauſe it was vnfurniſhed of ſouldiers: and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon alſo that it was not, according to his commandement, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently purueyed for of corn, &amp; other warlike munitions, &amp; fearing likewiſe that his letters of the 27. were by the enemie intercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, wrote vnto them y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 29. another to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame effect, with this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition:
<note place="margin">An other lettre ſent by the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of Orange to Leyden.</note> That if they well conſidered of the ſtrength of their Towne, although that the Eugliſhmen were not with them, yet that they might very well keepe out the enemie for 3. monethes, for if they were of one mind &amp; conſent, it was impoſſible for the enemie to take them perforce.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, they were well to weigh and conſider, that if ſo bee they did not all that was poſſible for men to doe, that they ſhould not only looſe theyr Towne of Leyden, but alſo all the whole Countrie beſides, whiche ſhould bee to them and their ſucceſſors amoſt curſed and ſhamefull reproch for euer.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:11838:113"/>
            <p>And therefore that they were luſtily to hold out the enemy, and ſo be the cauſe of not onely preſeruing themſelues, but of the whole countrie alſo, and get themſelues thereby, an euerlaſting famous name. And for the better effecting of this matter, ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to ſpend their victuals, after the example of the Harlemians, and Middlebroughians.</p>
            <p>Nowe followeth the anſwere to theſe letters, written the firſt of Iune: Although their corne would not ſtretch ſo farre as the time mentioned in thoſe letters, yet they hoped, luſtily to holde out the force of the enemie, during the time aforeſaide, yea they were fully reſolued rather to abyde the extremitie of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, then to become their enemies ſlaues. In the meane whyle, they required that the Delftians, Roterodamians, and Goudians, might be forbidden to ſuffer any victuals paſſe out of any of them by lande, becauſe the enemie ſhould therby be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weakened. Proteſting againſt them, that if they otherwiſe did, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they more ſought their owne priuate gain, then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> endoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of thoſe, who went about none other thing, but the turning away of the enemie from their gates. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And nowe let vs againe returne to Frauncis Baldez his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes. So ſoone as Baldez had, in this maner without anie great ordenance be ſieged the towne of Leyden: For hee right well knewe the merueilous charge of that, which was planted before Harlem, and withall the ſmall effect it wrought: he ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore knowing that it woulde leſſe auaile againſt this towne, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che was ſo notably ſtrengthned with mightie ſtrong Rampares, bethought him, either by ſugred ſpeeches, cunning letters, or ſeuere threates to ſubdue it: And for ſo much as hee had many fugitiue Hollanders with him, whoe were at his beeke and commandement, and at that time called in the Hollanders lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage <hi>Glippers,</hi> he entended to imploy them about theſe affaires, and it may bee y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was their owne ſute and requeſt, ſeeing there were ſome of them too too careleſſe for the loſſe and libertie of their countrie: and therefore thought by theyr ſundrie letters, written from diuers places to the Leydens, to draw them to the call, and ſo deceiue them: ſome of which ſaid letters ſhalbe here ſet downe at large as they were written, and the briefe contents onely of otherſome.</p>
            <pb n="109" facs="tcp:11838:113"/>
            <p>And firſte and formoſt, Iohn Adryanſon the wylde, and Ewout Arent, the ſonne of Gerard, ſente the twentie eyght of Maye from Harlem, to the Magiſtrate, and whole body of the Towne, the Letters hereafter following, ſigned with their hands, but not al written by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which made the matter great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be ſuſpected, that the Letters were no parte of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention.</p>

Wherefore, if they were ſo minded, that they might ſend their deputies: and for the ſuertie of their perſons, they offer the ſayd Captayne and Droſtat to hee their Oſtages or pledges, and to come to the Towne, vntill ſuch time as they had conferred with Frauncys Baldez, Generall of the Campe, who then laye at Haye, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>The 29. day aforeſaid, Iohn le Hutter, wrote a letter fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Hay to the Burroughmaiſters of Leiden, as it were to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame effect, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Hooghſtrate his letter was. He wrote, that ſome of his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties men of war, were returned againe into the countrie, to the end to eaſe and deliuer the payſauntes, of the great charges and exactions which were layde vpon them, and alſo of the Leydens, &amp; to offer them a general pardon, aſwel for the offences co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted
<pb facs="tcp:11838:115"/>in the yeare 1566. as at this preſent: and certified (as he which hath ſeene the precinctes of the exceptions) that no perſon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Leyden is excepted in the ſayde pardon, becauſe they had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a month ſithence refuſed to take in the Princes men of war, ſaue onely now about two daies paſt.</p>
            <p>And therfore he aduiſed them to accept of his Maieſties grace, while it is time, to the ende they fell not through the force of the Camp, which was at hand, into extreame miſerie and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie. And that Seigniour Baldez would make interceſſion for them by his Letters, vnto the great Commaundator, that they might euen with the firſt commers haue their parden: and therefore if they minded to accept thereof, that they ſhoulde ſend their deputies to parle of the matter. For ſo ſoone as they had gotten their pardon, they ſhould then be charged but with a ſmall garriſon of Almaines: promiſing them all ayd &amp; aſſiſtance for the doing hereof.</p>
            <p>The ſame daye alſo wrote Iohn Gautier of Wybeſma, to the Leydens, vehemently vrging the matter in the beginning of his Letters, and greatly commending their fidelitic, in that they had not receyued in, any of the Princes Garriſons, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that the ſame would greatly auaile them, and was a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſeruice for his maieſtin.</p>
            <p>He alſo ſet before them as the reſt did, the general pardon, and that it was not the kinges pleaſure, that there ſhould be any ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of bloud within his Cities and Townes. Counſelling them to keepe their Gates faſt locked, as well againſt his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties people, as alſo againſt the Princes, vntill ſuch time as they had obteined their requeſt, and gotten it ſigned with the kinges owne hand, promiſing them in the meane while to lye quietlye and ſtill, without doing any hurt to their Towne, and that they would giue commaundement, that all their Cattell ſhould free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feede in their medowes, and paſtures. Offering them to come in perſon to Leyden, and hazarde with them both theyr bodyes and goodes: promiſing beſides, that for ſeauen yeares ſpace, no not whiles he lyued, they ſhould haue any Garriſon in the Towne, for he know what the expreſſe charge was, which he had from his Maieſtie.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:11838:115"/>Deale not (ſaieth hee) with anye manne, and let none enter, vntyll ſuch tyme as I my ſelfe haue talked with you, and write vnto mee an aunſweare heereof, and let euery of vs be loyall and faithfull.</p>
            <p>My intent and purpoſe was, here to ſet downe the Hyſpanio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized Hollanders letters, thereby to ſhe we the conſtancy of the good Citizens, who notwithſtanding this ſweete and ſugred writing, and cruell threates, calling to minde the confederacye which they had made with an othe, remaining firme and conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, made theſe letters profitable vnto them. Let theſe letters and Citizens therefore, be an example to all the reſt of the Cities and townes, which hereafter may be beſieged, that in this or the like occaſion, they become ſtedfaſt and conſtaunt, and keepe their faith and promiſe with their fellow countrie men.</p>
            <p>After that the Papiſtes aforeſaid had been in councell at Zoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwood, and had there as in other places, inforced the payſants to lade theyr boates and barkes with earthen cloddes, ſeeing what ſmall effect their letters had wrought, but onely diſcouered thereby their owne intent and purpoſe, and encouraged the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, they ſo ſtraitly hemmed in, and couped vp the Citie with their Trenches and Forts, at Poele bridge, and Harlem Mere bridge, as that from thence foorth nothing could be carryed to the town, but in marueilous danger, which before might eaſily haue been done, &amp; in this maner the Goudeans attempted this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe the 6. of Iune.</p>
            <p>Certaine Citizens who by the ſodaine beſieging of the Towne, wild they nild they, were ſhut out of Leyden, had laden by his excellencies lycence, and the aſſiſtance of the Gouernour and Burroughmaiſters of Goude 30. Barkes, with wheat and Rye. By reaſon that two Payſaunts and a Marſhall had brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged that they would guyde them in a ſecrete way through Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piereka, which they had cut through, and after got into the barks to conduct them to Leyden.</p>
            <p>Nowe the Barques being well furniſhed with water men, and hauing alſo in euery of them two ſouldiers, ſayled by nyght to the ſayd Coppiereka, which they found to be very deepe cut, howbeit the payſaunt which ſhould haue beene their Pylot was not there: wherefore they ſayled on, and where they ſhould haue
<pb facs="tcp:11838:116"/>taken the left hande way, they tooke the right, ſayling ſtill a wronge courſe, vntill ſuch time as the day beganne to breake: and they thought the Payſant had betrayed them, who indeed, by reaſon of the greate payne that hee had taken, was fallen a ſleepe behinde in the way. Wherefore they returned backe to <hi>Gaude,</hi> without executing of this enterpriſe.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Leydens</hi> heard of this enterpriſe they tooke al the paynes that was poſſible to receiue them, for they attended the ſaide Barques on the <hi>Rhin,</hi> with certayne Freebutters, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſperate Aduenturers Boates, but all in vayne for this matter, and yet their goyng out was not altogether in vayne, for they tooke by force neere vnto <hi>Haynault</hi> bridge two waſters, and ſpeedily diſpatched thoſe that were within them. When they had thus done, they vnladed theſe ſhippes of all the prouiſion and furniture that was within borde, as artillary, munition, victualles, bread, beare, ſilkes, &amp; veluets, parchment lace of gold, ſiluer, and ſilke, fifteene peeces of ordinances called <hi>Baſes,</hi> three Barrelles of Corne pouder, and a very great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of bullets, and fraught their owne boates with them. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde, they bouged one of the enemies veſſels, and ſounke her, and ſet fire on the other, returning in the morning with their prize to the Towne. The Spanyardes who encamped at <hi>Leyerthorpe,</hi> made their account to ſtay theſe boates with all the whole prize within them, at the wood bridge: but the Citizens beyng in armour, looking for the comming of their boates with the victualles aforeſayd, very couragiouſly ſalyed out of <hi>Hoog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weert</hi> gate, and gaue the Alarme to <hi>Leyerthorpe</hi> forte, and ſkirmiſhed ſo luſtely with their enemies, as that the boates and the prize paſſed by: and beſides, they afterwards for the defence of the cattell, which the enemy went about to carrye away, ſo ſkirmiſhed with them, as that they returned all together with the ſayd butyn, without loſſe of any of the Towne cattell, hauing taken Priſoner amongeſt thoſe ſhippes, one <hi>Peter Quaegelate,</hi> an horrible Traytor to his countrey: whom they foorthwith exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, and quartered, and ſet vp his quarters vpon the citie gates: which thing the <hi>Leydens</hi> ſignified by their letters to his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, dated the 7. of Inne</p>

            <p>This young Lyon was afterwarde in a Skirmiſh: and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him ſelfe downe vpon the graſſe, the Spaniards tooke him, and hauing cut off his noſe and eares, they hoong him vp by the toes: But being a very hable and ſtrong man, hee layed handes on the haulter, and imped vp to the toppe of the Gallowes, wher the Enemy ſlew him with harquebuze ſhot.

            <p>Maiſter Thierry of Bronchorſt, his excellencies Subſtitute at Leyden, and being now made Gouernour thereof, The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate and Nobilitie conſidering that the ſiege might laſt long, and thereby turne to a diſtreſſe of famine, during this Moneth of Iune, made all the neceſſarieſt ordenaunce that poſſibly they could, aſwell for the long ſauing of their victualles, as alſo for the fortifiyng of their Rampars and Gates, the better and lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to keepe their Towne.</p>

And therfore the Gentle Reader may eaſily gheſſe vpon what kinde of victuals they fed moſt. There was alſo an ordenaunce ſet down for pot hearbes, and no milke to be ſolde, whereon butter might be made.</p>
            <p>Whiles the Towne of Leyden was in this ſorte beſieged, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Townſmen were altogether occupyed about making of prouiſion of al things neceſſary for the defence thereof, the principall parte of the ſayde Commaundators Armye arryued

For, at Bommell, which was well prouided of all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, was Captaine Baufour Colonell of the Scettiſhmen, with ſeauen Enſignes of Scottes, who dayly ſalied out with ſome Citizens and Gentlemen Hollanders, to ſkirmiſhe brauly with the Enemie: And beſides the ſufficient Garryſon, that was at Gorcum, and Louueſtein, there was alwayes meanes to ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Spaniard afterward determined to goe againſt Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum, where lay in Garriſon fiue companies of the Prince, to trouble and annoy the Spaniardes as much as was poſſible, that came from Antwarpe, where, by conſtraint and force, they made the Citizens pay them foure hundred thouſande.

            <p>This little village was ſhrewdly beaten with Artillery: but becauſe the Prince of Orenge would not caſt away his men, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the defence of ſo ruinous a place,
<note place="margin">Worcomme ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards.</note> and ſtanding onely vpon fiue familyes or houſholdes, he therfore commaunded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which were in it, to forſake it, and ſo they did: howbeit, they could not ſo well, nor ſo ſpeedily enbarque them ſelues, but that they lefte aboue 150 perſons behind them.</p>

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:11838:117"/>that ſhe was not able well to turne her ſelfe about, and therefore they forſooke them, and ſaued all her people in the reſt of the veſſels, except foure or fiue.

And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they haue the will and mynde to helpe you, yet you may eaſily conſider of the ſmall wayes that they haue to doe it withall, ſeeing they had (as you might if you woulde vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand) great buſines to doe for the men of warre which now are in their ſeruice: As at <hi>Gorcum,</hi> which preſently is beſieged with a greater Army then you are beſieged withall, and againſt his Maieſties puiſſaunt Army whiche commeth out of Spayne. Againe, ouer and beſides the loſſe of Count <hi>Lodwyke</hi> his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, amongeſt which there was no man more forwarde, yet were they ſo luſtely curried neere <hi>Nimmeguen,</hi> as that in a ſhort time, they loſt ſeuenteene Enſignes of the braueſt Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in their companie: to wit, the 6.

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:11838:118"/>at <hi>Worchum</hi> forte, were miſerablye cooled euen to the laſt man.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, if you ſhal conſider of the meanes which haue ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued your turnes to this preſent, for the maintena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the warre, as Chalices, Pixes, and capitall Impoſitions, which doe nowe greatly faile you, ſo that you now haue not any moe ſuch, or the like things to helpe your ſelues with: and againe, the daylie contributions, are for the more part taken from you, by reaſon that the whole Countrey is taken vp.</p>
                  <p>Ouer and beſides, the great power and force of his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie our moſt gracious Lord and naturall Prince,
<note place="margin">The king of Spaine ought to pawne his kingdomes, to make warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs.</note> who would rather pawne one of his kingdomes, were it <hi>Naples, Sicile, Sardigne,</hi> or anye other ſuch like, then ſuffer him ſelfe to bee ſpoyled of theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Countries, his moſt auncient Patrimonie, and Inheritaunce. What ſteppe or meane canne you anye way haue, to perſeuere in your great errours and anguiſhes, wherein you are ſo wrapped and ſwadled, with the great danger of the miſchiefe whiche is like to fall on your heades. And therefore, were it not better for you, to conforme and frame your ſelues vnto his Maieſties will and pleaſure, and in time and ſeaſon, accepte this his grace, whiche as yet is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally offered vnto you all: Nowe if anye of you woulde ſaye, that there woulde bee no promiſe kepte: The ſame is but a friuolous, and ſiniſter Imagination of ſome of you, who in theſe troubles canne helpe your ſelues, by other mennes loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
                  <p>For what greater aſſuraunce more is it poſſible for you to haue, then ſuche an aſſuraunce, as we haue vnderſtoode from the mouth of <hi>Monſieur de Licques,</hi> hee hath ſo aſſuredlye offered you: who beeyng a Gentleman of the beſt and aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cienteſt houſes of theſe lowe Countreyes, and of great poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, woulde not promiſe you, as you maye verie well thinke, anye thing whereof hee were not well aſſured, firmelie to bee able to perfourme vnto you, ſeeing his credite is as great in Court as anie mans: As you may very well vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by the Engliſh Souldiers, who yeelded them ſelues vnto him before your Towne: All which at his interceſſion, were very

Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore addreſſe your ſelues vnto him, rather then to any other ſtraunger,, and the ſooner the better: for we are certainly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed, that he ſhall ſhortly depart hence, to bee imployed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout greater affayres of his Maieſties.

Suffer not your ſelues to be abuſed by fables and trifling toyes, neither be you carryed away with a Wanhope, as it is very apparaunt that you are, and heartened and comforted thereto by ſome.

            <p>THE ſayd Matenes of <hi>Wybeſma,</hi> wrote alſo from the port of <hi>Poele</hi> the 22. of Iune 1574. to the <hi>Leydens:</hi> greatly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the pardon which was proclaymed the ſixte of Iune at <hi>Bruxelles:</hi> whom they as yet liked, but not alwayes. For, he made no litle to doe of the force, trenches, and fortes of his campe: and he ſo ſet downe all his fortes, with the names of a dozen of them, as that he thought it impoſſible for the towne to be victualed. He likewiſe offered free paſſage to the moſt Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eerous rebels to his Mateſty, that would come out. And beſides, he further offered, that if they feared to be deceiued, as the Duke of <hi>Alua</hi> deceiued them, to put him ſelfe, and others into the Towne for <hi>Oſtages,</hi> and there remayne, vntil ſuch time as they which went out, were not onely embarqued at <hi>Catwye,</hi> but alſo vntill (ſome of them beeyng ſafely arryued) had written newes thereof, and thereuppon might drawe the Articles of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>When the Prince vnderſtood the content of theſe letters, he wrote the 28. of this moneth, from <hi>Roterodam</hi> to <hi>Leyden,</hi> and amongſt other things, greatly thanked them for their conſtaney, admoniſhing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not to feare thoſe men, who ſhamed to ſubſcribe their names: &amp; beſides, confuted the iangling toyes of the firſt let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: &amp; told them, that the nemy had maliciouſly concealed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loſſe of their ſhippes, but eſpecially, the loſſe of the 2000. Souldiers in North Holland.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>de Licques</hi> and his fautors, from whom it was thought the firſt letters came, or it may bee, that <hi>Baldez</hi> and his friends ſeeing that theſe letters, and the letters from <hi>Wibeſma,</hi> tooke as little effect as the firſt, ſought by all meanes poſſible
<pb facs="tcp:11838:120"/>to ouercharge the Citizens, and recompence their vertue and conſtancie, with as wicked dealing as was poſſible for men to doe. Wherefore, they conſidering in what great ſteede their Garden herbes ſtoode them, becauſe they had plentifully ſowen of them in the month of May, which was their chiefe food and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, built a fort, betweene the 17. &amp; 18. of Iuly, neere to <hi>Rhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brough</hi> gate at the very entrance or mouth of the riuer, to barre the Citizens, from comming out of the gate, to goe to their Kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin gardens.</p>
            <p>Neuertheleſſe, the aforeſaide <hi>M. Thierry de Bronchorſt,</hi> who during the ſiege, had valiantly behaued himſelfe vnto the death, had by the aduiſe of the magiſtrate, ordeined a certayne rewarde, for whatſoeuer Citizen, ſhoulde firſt ſet foote into the ſayd fort. Wherefore, a great number of them ſalied out at the gate at once, and ſo luſtely charged the enemy, as that they were enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with great loſſe, and ſhame inough, to forſake the place, the 18. of Iuly.</p>
            <p>When the great commandator &amp; his adherents ſaw, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a great number of their enterpriſes tooke no effect, &amp; that the Townes in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zelande</hi> and els where, were ſo well prouided for, as that they could doe little or nothing that Su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer, they put their whole confidence in the great armie at ſea, which came out of Spayne, the fame whereof more and more ſo ſpread abroad, as that it might indeede haue ſo fallen out, had not the Lorde God by his ſecret iudgements as wel by the peſtilence, as otherwiſe, prouided well for the matter.</p>
            <p>But to the end ſome diligence in the performing hereof might appeare, as wel at Rome by the Pope &amp; his Cardinals, as alſo in Spayne by the fathers of the holy Inquiſition, by their actes &amp; proweſſes, and that the aforeſayde holy fathers might ſee, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uppon theyr money was beſtowed, <hi>Chiapin Vitelli,</hi> about this time, had with fifteene Enſignes of <hi>Swyſſes,</hi> and other enſignes of Span<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And about noone they came to a parle, wherein they demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

            <p>The 10. of Iuly, the <hi>Leydens</hi> coyned certaine peeces of ſiluer of 28. &amp; 14. ſouls a peece.

            </p>
            <p>The 29. of the ſaid moneth Proclamatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was made, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no beare ſhould be made aboue 24. ſouls the barrell. In this meane while was <hi>Leyden</hi> very ſtraightly beſieged, but eſpecially about Haye gate, where one captaine <hi>Carion</hi> a ſpaniard, had entre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ched him ſelfe at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Waddinghe, &amp; made many loope holes to ſhoot through in the dikes, &amp; his firſt tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch ran alongeſt hard to Boſhuyſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che greatly anoied the towne. Wherefore the Citizens, becauſe they had no ſouldiers, concluded to ſalie out in this manner.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Gerard Lane,</hi> went out in a Gally well purueied of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillary, and the greater part of his Citizens, were Muſketters. Maiſter <hi>Iohn Duuenword,</hi> captaine of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Aduenturers or Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butters, iſſued out by the Fleet, the one halfe of his people being appoynted with long ſtaues, called Sprittes, and the other halfe, ſhot. And <hi>Adrian Scot</hi> went out at the <hi>Rinbrough</hi> gate. The two Companies of Maiſter <hi>Iohn Does</hi> Lorde of North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wike, with Bartholomew Hauies, tooke in hand to ſee vppon the Fort and trench, at Boſhouſe bridge. At the place called the Sand, were placed a good manie of Pyoners. Now when all thinges were thus prepared and ſet in order, and a rewarde ſet downe for the firſt that entred y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fort, &amp; for euery Spaniards head, ſo ſoone as the fire was lighted, they all at once with a great noyſe and crie on euery ſide, ſet vpon the Fort, eſpecially the Companies of the Lorde of Northwike and of Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mew hauies. The 60. Spaniards which were in the fort, vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auntly defended them ſeues with their muſkettes, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> townes men were gotten ſo neere the Fort, as that they puſhed at them
<pb facs="tcp:11838:121"/>in the fort, with their foreſayd long ſtaues, &amp; ſo ſoone as they had diſcharged theyr Harquebuzes,
<note place="margin">The Citizeus of Leydeu, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niardes fort.</note> they fel vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enimie. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane while, the citizens approched with their fire works: to wit, with vials of glaſſe full of gunpouder &amp; brimſtone, hauing lighted matches hanging without them: and caſt thoſe vials into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fort of the enemy: whereupon the Spaniardes were enforced to forſake their trench or fort where the citizens entred, &amp; there ſlew their enemies, who in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deſtroying of the fort, were roſted there aliue, and buried by the Citizens, without hauing mercy vppon anye, although they very lamentably cryed vpon them: <hi>Miſericordia, Miſericordia.</hi> And the Pioners aforeſayd, were ſo buſie againſt the enemy, at a trench neere <hi>Poeley</hi> bridge, as that they came not time enough to lay flat the forte, and therefore the Citizens themſelues did it.</p>
            <p>During theſe exploites, by reaſon of the ſigne of the fire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſayde, Alarme was ſounded through all <hi>Baldez</hi> his Campe: inſomuch that they of <hi>Lammen,</hi> came to helpe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Wadding: &amp; ſo did like wiſe the horſemen of <hi>Leyerthorpe, Forſcote,</hi> &amp; <hi>Waſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenar:</hi> who with a few of thoſe which ſcaped, gaue three aſſaults vpon the loſt forte, but they were with ſhame and loſſe inough, luſtely repulſed. Now becauſe the Citizens meant not to keepe the ſaide fort, but raze it, if it were poſſible, and to ſhewe, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there were no ſouldiers in the Towne, yet that neceſſity &amp; daylie experience made a ſouldier, being alſo of neceſſity driuen to retyre, by reaſon of the force of the enemy which came vppon them, they, after this braue ſkyrmiſh of two houres, retyred them felues towards the towne. Thus the 29. of Iuly they made ready hande, &amp; ſpeedy diſpatch of an hundred Spaniards &amp; Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians, or neere thereabout.</p>
            <p>It were ouer long to write of the continuall ſkyrmiſhing that was there,
<note place="margin">The Leyde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are ouer forward in ſkirmiſhing.</note> both on the 14. &amp; 15. of Iuly, by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the kine that went thereabout, beyng very neere to the number of 700. For the Citizens were growen now ſo warre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, and forward in ſkirmiſhing, as that the Magiſtrate was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to call them from it with the ſound of a bell. And here is to be vnderſtood, that none of <hi>Baldez</hi> campe euer tooke the value of one Towe, but that it coſt the liues of ſome of his ſouldiers, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trench without y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wood gate, becauſe they we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t

And it was a maruellous thing to ſee, how this kynd of cattel had the wyt to ſaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnder the Towne in the time of neceſſitie, for by vſe, they had learned to know the ſhooting, both of the Harquebouze, and alſo of the great ordinaunce.</p>
            <p>During theſe Exploites,

               <hi>Baldez</hi> people which lay at <hi>Haye</hi> and therabout, atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted the Towne of <hi>Delft,</hi> which they thought to obteine by reaſon of certaine intelligence &amp; conference y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they had with ſome of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> town: but they were therein deceiued, becauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theſe inhabitants faithfully dealt in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter, in aduertiſing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> magiſtrate therof.

But as the keies of the gate, were not ſo ready at hand as they ought to haue byn, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the draw bridge was ſo long, before it could be let downe, which might be, by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the feare y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> tooke ſome of them who had commiſſion to do it, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſpaniards we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tbacke, being ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by the great ordinance of the Towne, but it came too late, for there was no hurt at al done.</p>

And therfore I ſay, it was concluded vpon, and declared by a common accord: That better is a waſte, then an vtterly loſt countrey: and ſo agreed, that the ſcluſes ſhould be taken vp, that all South Holland, if it were poſſibly, might bee laide vnder the water, both by the laying open of theſe ſcluſes, as alſo by the cutting of the Dykes which ſtand, eyther vpon the <hi>Maze</hi> or vpon <hi>Yſſele:</hi> procuring by this meane a Sea, to ebbe and flowe vppon the firme lande, that they might, after the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was become once nauigable, ſayle to <hi>Leyden,</hi> for the victual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and ayding thereof.

            <p>The Leydens made no anſwere to this letter, neyther were they any whit the more afeard or diſcouraged: But according to the example of the Bethulians, and Iohel his doctrine, they fell to prayer and faſting, being expreſly commaunded by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, not once to thinke that they deſerued any thing by reaſon of this faſt. And beſides, they ordeyned certeine lawes and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunces, and the 2. of Auguſt they were commaunded to take vp all their horſes out of the medowes, and ſtable them in the Towne, to the ende their milch kine might feede the longer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brode: and at that time they began to kill the kine that were dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vp: And the fift day, they made ordenaunces concerning their fleſh victual, and Graynes, which they then began to bake, which kind of foode, although they eſteemed not of it ſo well as of bread, yet coſt it more then the rye bread, for a pound of it, coſte 13.

            <p>The Leydens ſtanding in this eſtate, wrote to his excellency the 21 of Auguſt,
<note place="margin">The Leydens write a letter to his Excellency.</note> as foloweth. That his excellency right wel vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by their laſt Letter in what ſtate they ſtood, that theyr graines would ſerue them but foure dayes longer, whereupon it appeared, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they had made a verygood reckoning for 3. mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ths, to wit, to liue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt 2. month with bread, &amp; the third in miſery &amp; pouerty.

And beſides that they greatly marueiled that they neuer receiued Letters from the

            <p>But before theſe letters were diſpatched, the <hi>Leydens</hi> had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued letters from his excellency, by which he aduertiſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of all that heretofore hath bin ſaid, and how hie the water was already riſen, wherat they greatly reioyſing, highly thanked his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency: ſignifiyng to him further, which of them in their opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s was firſt to be cut &amp; let out, ſending theſe two letters the 22. of this moneth.

And ſome, who vntill then had diſſimuled the matter, ſaide in a mockery: now on afore my <hi>Gueſes,</hi> get you vp into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> top of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tower, &amp; with your lookes goe before the water of the Maze, with many other reprochfull words not worthy here to be ſet down: inſomuch that many cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly mates, became not only faint hearted, but alſo by little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to breede diſſention.</p>
            <p>The Magiſtrate, and the reſt that were in authority, ſeeking to preuent this inconuenience, they therefore, to the end to encreaſe the courage of their citizens, &amp; eſpecially with all poſſible dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to furder their aide and deliuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, ſent the 27. of Auguſt, 3. of their citizens with 2. letters: The one written to his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie, and the other to the ſtates of Holland their confederates. The contents of which concerned chiefly the eſtates, whom they, but in very deed cauſeles, charged with negligence, forſomuchas they had not, before the ſiege written vnto them one word, &amp; that they lay as ſtill, as if there had bin no confederacy between the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with many other thinges moe. Further declaring, that they had moſt miſerably abidden diſtreſſed, the whole tyme by his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
<pb facs="tcp:11838:124"/>prefixed: and that they ſawe as yet none other thinge but vaine hope: And therefore proteſted before the moſte mightie GOD, and the whole woride, that they hadde done their dueties, and no faulte to bee founde on their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, but in the Eſtates: who might ſee, when conuenyente tune ſhoulde ſerue, that they were able to excuſe them ſelues thereof: And therefore required, that in caſe they were no waye able to helpe them, or that there was no hope in the meanes alreardye begunne, to ſende them flatte woorde there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that they might bee diſcharged of their othe and confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.</p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> at that time was viſited with a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous daungerous diſeaſe: which was not the leaſt threate of the Lord vnto his people, who were very heauy and ſorrowfull for the ſame, and therefore he could by no meanes aunſweare theſe letters. In the meane while, the <hi>Leydens</hi> put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution the ordinaunce which fortie of them had agreed vppon, and made an Inuentorie of all the Ryne, Beefes, Sheepe, Calues and hogges, and all the ſtreetes &amp; houſes were bylled, wherein were any. There were alſo deputed <hi>Cornelius Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las of Aix,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Lucas of Waſſena</hi> Commiſſaries, as well for this matter, as alſo for all other kinde of fleſhe, Larde, and whatſoeuer els,
<note place="margin">The Leydens make an Inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of all the cattel and victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als they haue.</note> who, according to reaſon and equitie were to looke to this geare, to the ende that no man ſo long as it was poſſible to helpe it, ſhoulde periſhe through famine. And if any man was founde to conceale any cattell or victualles, the ſame to bee taken from him, and him ſelfe to bee puniſhed. All kinde of Cattell was taxed, and the magiſtrate gaue to the Owner, according to the value of the taxing. And from thence foorth a Lot was caſt from foure dayes to foure dayes, to kill as much cattell, as neceſſarilie might ſerue for thoſe aforeſaide dayes, to witte to euery Powle, halfe a pounde of fleſhe the day.</p>
            <p>Whiles the <hi>Leydens</hi> were in this eſtate, the water had by little and little ouerflowed al the whole Countrey ouer, and all preparation poſſible, was made for the helpe and deliuerie of the Towne: and at Roterodam, arriued the Admirals of <hi>Flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing</hi> and <hi>Sierickſea:</hi> to wit, <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Boyſot</hi> Lord of <hi>Ruart,</hi> &amp;

            <p>The ſumme of <hi>Wibiſma</hi> his letter aforeſayd was this: That about two monethes paſſed, he had written them letters, which concerned both their profit and welfare, and yet receiued no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweare from them. But becauſe that he &amp; his adherents were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they had no more corne left in the towne, &amp; that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple liued &amp; fed vpon rootes, graines, &amp; other kind of ſuche like ſoole, which cauſed great mortality amongſt them: &amp; wold more &amp; more cauſe it, if they looked not better to it: &amp; beſides, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theyr ſtate &amp; condition would ſtil grow from ill to worſe, conſidering it was impoſſible for them to be holpen: &amp; that the water whiche came in vpon them, did them more hurt then good, forſomuch as that the countrey vpon the <hi>Rhyn,</hi> was higher then the countrey of <hi>Scye,</hi> or <hi>Delft,</hi> ſo that it could not poſſibly be brought to paſſe to make the water ouerflow it.</p>
            <p>And beſides, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the princes ſuccours which were betweene 30. &amp; 40. enſignes, could by no meanes help, becauſe the paſſages were ſo guarded, as that it was impoſſible for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to come to <hi>Leyden.</hi> Furthermore, that there arriued at <hi>Leyerthorpe</hi> 600. olde tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Souldiers all ſhot, ſo that there were in that place three thouſand olde Spaniſh ſouldiers, beſides 27.

And that if there were any within the Towne who miſtruſted the matter, that ſafe conduct ſhold be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them, to goe whither ſoeuer they thought beſt themſelues.

Laſtly, wiſhing them to vnderſtande, that they might bee brought from a mifera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble eſtate vnto libertie. Theſe preſent letters were ſubſcribed, by Cornelius de la Hoogh, the ſonne of Nicholas, Gerard Roelofs, Nicholas Dom, the ſonne of Iohn Buyte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>wech, Bartholomew Alewyins, Geerbrand Mees, Iohn Adrianſon de Wylde, Rene, the ſonne of Iames, and I. Thierry. The Leydens the ſixt of the ſayd moneth anſwered theſe letters: That they had ſworn to the prince of Oreng, as liuetenant &amp; Captaine general for his maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie in Holland, &amp; like wiſe to the Eſtates of the ſaid countreye. And vntill ſuch time as they were diſcarged of that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ath, they hoped to keepe it.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, they demaunded paſſeport, before they came to a parle, to the end they might ſend ſome of their Citizens to his Excellency and the Eſtates, promiſing that they ſhould returne within eight dayes.</p>
            <p>The Leydens deſired this paſſeport vnder this coulour, that they might more ſafely ſend their meſſengers about their other affaires: And this was a ſtratageme or warlike pollicy againſt
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:11838:126"/>Enemies from whome they craued this, to keepe them in that opinion: for they right well knew, that an Hare could not well get out of Leyden, through their Campe, becauſe it was ſo ſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghtly beſieged, and therfore much leſſe could their Meſſengers goe towardes his Excellency without their leaue: although they knewe contrariwiſe, three other wayes: yea, for the verye ſame night, that the Enemies thought them ſelues moſt ſafe, they went out, and paſſed where a man would haue thought it moſte impoſſible. And beſides, they knew wel inough the popiſh faith, and ſpaniſh promiſes, and alſo after what manner the Comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dator had handled the Granadoes.</p>
            <p>The fugitiues of Leyden, which were at Leyerthorpe, had already made their reckoniug, that they ſhould home to their houſes, for ſo they verely thought, when as they ſayd vnto the Meſſengers: what excuſe are you able to make for your ſelues: In deede the Harlemians might haue ſome excuſe, to ſaye that the ſouldiers enforced them to hould out ſo long: But you haue no ſouldiers, and therfore are no way excuſable, nor no grace to be left for you: for they neuer thought, that the Leidens meaning was to make the names of their fellowe Citizens, euen by their owne teſtimonies, immortall, and them ſelues receyue euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting ſhame. For once it was well knowne, that in the firſt place, Leyden was enforced to paye all the men of warre with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Campe. And ſome of the fugitiues haue ſithence the deliueraunce, expreſſely confeſſed euen in the Towne of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdame: That notwithſtanding all the fayre promiſes of the Spaniardes, there was a deuice, if they had entred the towne, to haue murdred all the defenſable perſonnes, yea, all the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed women.</p>
            <p>And it may be, that the young damſels might haue found fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, becauſe the Spaniards would haue abuſed them, for the ſeruing of their filthy luſis and pleaſures.</p>
            <p>This wryting from ſo manye and ſundry places, beeganne to breede ſome Ielouſie: For, euery man ſought moſt careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye to gette all the commendation that was poſſyble to bee had at the Commandators handes, for the yeelding vp of Leyden, which in part appeared, by Iohn de Huiter his Letters, dated the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>yenth of September, from Leyerthorpe, to the Lorde
<pb facs="tcp:11838:127"/>of Northwyke when as he ſayd: When that your Dromb was come to the Campe, I my ſelfe was there preſent, but ſo farre forth as I am able to iudge, the Generall of the Campe is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with the Colonnell and Captaine, becauſe they ſuffered the Trumpet paſſe with certeine Letters. Wherefore, I woulde ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe you, as a friend, That if you intend to treat of the matter, to doe it with Baldez, whom you know to be mercifull, to the end that all thinges might paſſe through his handes, as Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of the Campe. For if you doe not ſo, he will take it in euill part, and therby doe you no good.</p>
            <p>And I, as a frieud to the Towne, wherein I continued fiue yeares in the flower of mine age, coulde not but aduertiſe you hereof.</p>
            <p>Theſe foreſayde Letters, were not altogether vnprofitable or fruiteleſſe in the hearts of ſome vnconſtant men: and as if the Towne of Leyden had not beene already ſufficiently ouerchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with three plagues and ſcourges, which commonlye goe hande in hande together, to wit, plague, peſtilence, and famine, the fourth paine is ioyned hereunto: For many Citizens, who had hitherto diſſimuled the matter, ſaid, that they had redeemed their toong of a Lombard: becauſe that the Commiſſary Bron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chorſt aforeſayd, died the 6. of September, who, if he had liued, would haue coupled ſuch braue pratlers to the Gallows, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that he was a good and ſeuere Iuſticer in the Towne, ſo that whyles hee lyued, both Papiſte and Gueſe-feared him. Howebeit, of this inconſtancie, which was alſo amongſt ſome of the Lordes of the Towne, we will hereafter ſpeake more at large.</p>
            <p>Nowe, when the Admyralles aforeſayde, through the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the Hollanders, the chiefe of which being Maiſter Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius of Bronchorſt, Maiſter Henrye Duyſt, and M. Lenyn, were according to the neceſſitie, reaſonably well furniſhed and appoynted, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the 5. of September, certeine barques had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered, that the Lymittes and diuiſions of the fieldes, were not paſſing a foote and a halfe aboue the water, his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cye appoynted that the Dikes betweene Soetermeir, and Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuene ſhould be opened, that they might come downe from thence, vnto Soetermen Mere, which is about a quarter
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:11838:127"/>of a myle, from the diuiſions of the fieldes aforeſaide: ſo that the Admiralles before named departed the 11. of the ſayd Month, with many other Captaynes of Holland, and Deputies of the Eſtates and Admiraltie, alongſt by the Rott, hauing 30. Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and certeine other which came from Delft and Gaude, and the victuallers, two Enſignes of Pyoners, and other neceſſarye thinges, ſayling towardes the diuiſions of the fieldes aforeſayde. And beſides, his Excellencie had appoynted certeine Enſignes of ſouldiers, to wit, Frenchmen, the Captaine of the Guarde. Durant, and Catteuille, for thedefending of the Trenches in the place aforeſaid, on both ſides, an houre before day, and if it were poſſible, before the enemy ſhould perceiue them, which with merueilous diligence they perfourmed: and the two Admyrals placed their ſhippes on eyther ſide, to defende the trench with their Artillery. Halfe an houre before the trench was finiſhed, the Spaniards came from Soetermeir, towards the place afore ſaid, to ſkirmiſh, appoynting on the hye fieldes ſide, to witte, the common fielde, about fiue braue companies of Almaines. The French which were of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Regiment of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Coloniel of the guard, and other of his Excellencies Guarde, which were come thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of pleaſure: notwithſtanding that the Admyrall Boyſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, had prayed and commaunded them, not to come neere the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my within the Cannon ſhotte, yet ranne they ſo f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ercely out of their Trenches, as that the Admyrall with his ſhippes, coulde not play with the Artyllery as they would: howheit the artillery only of 6. Gallyes, gaue them the whole ſide ſo luſtely, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they durſt not only march forward, but were alſo twiſe enforced with loſſe and ſhame enough, to returne to Soetermeir, and there were no moe wounded, but the Admiralles pylot onely, &amp; that was with a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> harquebuz ſhot, &amp; a few of his mariners lightly hurt.</p>
            <p>Now on the other ſide, to wit, from Wylſuene or Leyther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam quarter, in the euening came the Spaniards both on foote &amp; on horſback, where was a braue ſkirmiſh. And by reaſon of the ſmall ſhotte, and the great Ordenaunce, which on the ſide luſtelye diſpled them from the Gallyes, they were conſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of verye ſhame to retyre: ſo that the Gallyes which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued with ſtrength of ores ſlew ſome of their horſes and alſo the ryders. But herein fell out a very cruell deede, committed by a
<pb facs="tcp:11838:128"/>zelanber, who haue a wonderful deſire to be fleſht of the Span<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes, and the Spaniards likewiſe of them. For the zelanders had learned it of the Spaniardes former deedes, who had lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame of the Mores &amp; Turks (althogh in very deed it is no whit commendable in a Chriſtian) and the matter was thus. A ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander had taken one of the ſtaine Spaniardes, and pluckt the heart out of his body, as hee lay halfe dead, and when hee had gnawne it with his teeth, hee caſt it awaye from him.
<note place="margin">The mariners fleſht vpon a Spaniard.</note>
            </p>
            <p>This gnawne heart was afterwarde ſeene at Delft by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye credible people, and the very prynte of the teeth in it. There were alſo after that, as it ſhould ſeeme, certeine lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin verſes ſet forth by the Lorde of Northwike vppon the ſame deede: as followeth.

            <p>There were amongeſt this company certaine French gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen Captaines, as Catteuille, Durant, and Guilereſſe, who were too too forwarde with theyr ſouldiers againſt the enemie, for they had gotten with their barkes, behinde the turf heapes, not farre from the enemies houſes &amp; trenches, thinking to haue ſet them on fire. But the Admyrall retyring without any noyſe,
<pb facs="tcp:11838:130"/>and not knowing them to bee ſo farre foorth, the enemie percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them to bee there, ſo luſtily aſſailed them with ſuch a great number of boates, as that Catteuille, Guilereſſe, and ſeuen ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers moe, by reaſon of the reculing of their barke, were drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <p>But Durant and certaine ſouldiers with him, ſaued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues by ſwimming, neuertheleſſe the enemie as it was after well knowne, receiued a farre greater loſſe, through the ſhooting off, of the great ordenance. For, their boates were full fraught with their dead, hurt, and gald men, and carried to Vtright: Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that ſome ſcoffing fellowes, ieſted and ſaide, That fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Gray was very deare ware, becauſe that whoſoeuer woulde goe to the Popes heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt needes bee buryed in a Fryers Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors coule, and the time was that they would put them coffyn &amp; all into the coule, when as they carryed them very vnſauery from the campe, as commonly it fell out both at Amſterdam and alſo at Vtright, where they are buried in the body of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church.</p>
            <p>And although the princes armie, had with the great ordena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce merueilouſly annoied the enemie, as had alſo the valiant ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Colonels of the Baron of Noyelle, and of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the guarde, yet it ſhoulde ſeeme, that they wonne no great matter by it. For the water roſe not ſo high, as they looked for, and that was by reaſon of the infinite thouſandes of haſſocks which ſucked vp the water, the winde alſo ſerued them to no pur poſe: and beſides, the enemie vſed many and ſundrie meanes to draine the water aſide.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, the ſaid bridge was marueilous ſtrongly fortif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Howbeit, the Lorde God purueyed for them two ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of wayes: to wit, firſt by reaſon of the Nottheaſt wynde which blew vp a mightie gabe, the 18.19. &amp; 20. dayes of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember: &amp; ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly through the good counſell y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was giuen to M. Peter Waſtell, one of his Excellencies counſell, who in this dealing was very diligent and carefull: for as he was deuiſing with two countrie men, they told him, that they needed not paſſe by that bridge, ſeeing they might paſſe the way called Segwart,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:11838:130"/>lying betweene Soetermeir and Benthouſe. When the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour heard thus much, he tolde it to his Excellencie, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> campe, ſate hereupon in councell, with the Admiral Noielles, the Captaine of the guarde, and with certaine eſtates of the Admiraltie, and they all concluded, as aboueſaid.</p>
            <p>And heereupon, Admyral Boyſot, accompauied with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell aforeſaide, with the guard, eight gallies, and ſenentie ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, directed his courſe that night towards Segwart way, and there arriued before ſuch time as the enemie had any vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of them: for, the vice Admyrall lay with the armie before the ſaid Soetermeir bridge.</p>
            <p>Nowe, when they had gotten this way, the Captaine of the guard, deſired Citadelle an Italian Gentleman, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Baron of Noielles Lieuetenant, to fortifie and entrench with Vawgiraut, and halfe the ſouldiers on Benthouſe ſide: And maſter Bochart with Captaine Ladriere, and the other halfe of the ſouldiers, on Soetermeir ſide. And the meaning here of was this, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> although the whole force of the enemie ſhould ſodenly breake vpon them, yet thought they hereby ſafely to returne to their ſhips, howbeit all in vaine: for the enemie ſeeing himſelf deceiued, had no great ſtomacke to ferrit them out: and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Almaines who lay at Bent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, ſo ſoone as night came, ſhewed a faire payre of heeles, &amp; they which lay at Soetermeir, in the morning forſooke their trench, &amp; retired towards Leyden, to wit, towardes Northaſke, Soeterwouwe, Kyrkwegge, &amp; Weyport, carrying with them their artillarie, and fortified themſelues in manie houſes, Now, the treaches in Segwart way, were not finiſhed withoute the great trauell of the princes people, who labored all that night vp to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knees in the water, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wind mightilye blowing at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> North-Eaſt. The next morrow Admirall Boyſot, ſent the Captaine of the guarde to looke for the armie, which through Gods mightie hand, arriued there, without the loſſe of any one man.</p>
            <p>The Almaines aforeſaid, were no ſooner gone fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Benthouſe but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> captaine Ladriere had gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their trench. When the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces people were paſſed Segwart way, hauing ſet on fire the houſes which ſtood on Soetermeir way, Captaine Cret an Orengian arriued at Soetermeir with three companies of ſouldiers, and the arke of Delft. This Arke,
<note place="margin">The arke of Delft.</note> was a ſtrange
<pb facs="tcp:11838:131"/>buylt and trymmed veſſell, well furniſhed with great ordenance, but very noyſome to the armie, by reaſon of the lownes of the water, inſomuch that they thought once to haue burnt her, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhee had in her betwixt fifteene &amp; twentie peeces of greate ordenance, they founde the meanes to bring her to the foreſaide place, that ryding there, ſhee might keepe the paſſage. This Arke, was built of two ſhippes ioyned together, and was rowed neither with ſprites, nor ores, neither yet oriuen with the helpe of any ſailes, but by wheeles, wrought within her, &amp; ſo very ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly built all ouer, as that no muſket ſhot was able to pearſe her. She was of burden able to beare fiftie luſtie men for defence, and twelue to turne the wheeles.</p>
            <p>The next morrow they were determining, whether they ſhould goe on, or tarrie a while longer. The Admirall Boyſot thought it beſt to purſue the enemie, reculed: and to the ende that both the Leydens, and alſo the enemie might deſcrie him a farre off, hee was reſolued, to take this enterpriſe in hande, with twentie Gallies, and appoynted the reſt of the armte to follow him. Wee haue heeretofore ſpoken how the veſſels which beare the demie Canons, were riuen with the force of the Canon. But becauſe they had neede of them, they were ſpeedily new calked, pitched, and tallowed at Delft, and beeing trimmed with leadde and ſalt bydes againſt the force of the pouder, they folowed the armie the thyrde day after. The Admirall hauing ſailed not paſſing a myle from benthouſe, was tolde as it was gheſſed, that aboute the waters which ranne downe towardes Norta, that the enemy might ſtrengthen himſelfe in certayne houſes thereabout, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, when they had inquired after it, the thing was found to bee farre otherwiſe: wherfore he mad towards Norta, and got him euen within a muſket ſhot thereof, where hee might perceiue how that betweene two or three hundred well armed Almaines, had left two houſes, and were fled with all poſſible ſpeede, to the other ſide of Norta little Meere, where the Spaniardes were intrenched. Whereupon the Admirall luſtily purſued them with force of Oares, and orderly enbattailed himſelfe within an barquebuze ſhot of the enemie. From this trenche in Norta houſes, were the muſkets brauely diſcharged, but the Orengi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſo defended themſelues with their great ordenance, as that
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:11838:131"/>the Spaniarde knewe not where to hide his head.</p>
            <p>When the aforeſaid Almaines had cloſely conueyed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues behinde two hay ſtackes, to keepe them out of the danger of the great ſhot, they retyred towards <hi>Soeterwood:</hi> which ſkir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhe laſted from noone, vntill the Euening: But about myd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, the Admyrall cauſed an Alarme to be giuen by certayne ſmall ſhot, whom the Spaniardes aunſweared foure or fiue tymes, to the end, to ſhew them, that they were not departed, but they fearing of ſurpriſing, ſo ſtilly and flyly retyred towards <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eterwood,</hi> as that the Admirall neuer perceyued it, vntill the next morrow.</p>
            <p>The Orengians were greatly annoyed, by reaſon that the Spaniardes had ſtopped the courſe of the water, whiche ranne downe towardes <hi>Soeterwood:</hi> &amp; beſides, they were in a greate fault, in that they made not a trenche at the entrie of the little <hi>Meere:</hi> for if they had, the Admyrall had found as daungerous a peece of work of it, as was the enterpriſe at <hi>Soetermeir</hi> bridge: howbeit, the Lord God meaning to increaſe his glory, ſo blinded them, as that they became ſenſleſſe. When all the reſt of the army were come with the great ordinance,
<note place="margin">The liuelines of a luſty captaine, reuined men halfe dead.</note> the Admiral &amp; al his whole army were gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into a very large &amp; broad ſtreame, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning towardes <hi>Suyten,</hi> where they diſcharged all their greate ordinaunce, becauſe the <hi>Leydens</hi> ſhould both ſee, heare, and bee encouraged, for in ſeuen daies before, they had not heard ſo much as a worde from them. The <hi>Leydens</hi> againe aunſweared them with their great ordinaunce, in token, that they were not as yet diſcouraged, although their food was no better then Cow beefe, and horſe fleſh. They had in the towne about nientie horſes, and from the foureteenth of September, they beganne to diſtribute halfe a pound of theſayde horſe fleſh to a man for one dayes vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Colleagues</hi> and adherents of proud <hi>Baldez,</hi> came dayly before the gates of the Towne, menacing, mocking, and ieſting, and mixing withall ſometimes very ſweete and ſugred wordes. And on a tyme certayne of his Captaynes and Officers, mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with a young youth, going fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Towne to <hi>Leyer thorp:</hi> ſayde vnto him: Tell your Townes men, that it is as poſſible for your Prince to aide and deliuer your Towne, as it is for you,
<pb facs="tcp:11838:132"/>to catch the ſtarres in the ſkie with your handes. Theſe were the flaunderous, high, and proude woordes of this Infidell <hi>Maran,</hi> and of his adherentes, who thought themſelues to haue as well prouided for the Campe, and ſiege about the Towne, as that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Townes men, nor yet any man liuing, was able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand him, or hinder his deuiſe: neuer thinking that there was a God, who could and woulde deliuer the poore afflicted ſoules from the handes and ſword of the Tyrant. Howbeit theſe threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning wordes, &amp; faire promyſes withall, were not altogether fruitleſſe, becauſe they wrought effectually in ſome inconſtant &amp; vnſetled mynds: by which they being moued by reaſon of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great famyne, which ſo grieuouſly touched the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there was like to haue bin a manifeſt diſcord in the Town, had not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord God by M. <hi>Iames</hi> &amp; <hi>Iohn de la Does,</hi> Lords of <hi>Northwyke,</hi> wiſely and grauely prouided againſt it. For about the very ſelf ſame tyme, that theſe things thus fel out, 15. Citizens (who as they ſaid, had aboue 300. moe of theyr confederacy) went to the Towne houſe, calling for victuals, and that if none were there to be had, that meanes might be found for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> prouiding of ſome: where one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Borroughmaiſters proteſted,

For where ſome of the reſt of the Magiſtrates, earneſtly trauelled to perſwade the people of the great mercy of <hi>Baldez,</hi> and of the notable par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and withall, of the promiſes conteyned within the letters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue written, theſe men on the other ſide ſet before the eyes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſimple and faynthearted Citizens, all examples to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. For the ſayde pardon was by ſome, ſo luſtely mainteyned, as that they ſhamed not to giue their good fellow citizens reproch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful words only, but of a froward affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> belied the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo: ſaying, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they which truſted not to the pardon, were erra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the eues, which ſaying, put them in great feare: not ſticking beſides, freely to cry out &amp; ſay, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they had redeemed the to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs of their <hi>Lombard:</hi> &amp; this ſpeech, as before hath byu ſayde, aroſe by reaſon that the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:11838:132"/>Bronchorſt was dead, who ſo long as he liued helde them at the ſtaues end, and truſſed ſome of them vp in an halter.</p>
            <p>Ouer &amp; beſides theſe iniurions &amp; reprochfull words, the ſecret councels which they there oftentimes held, came to litle effect, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord God had ſtirred vp the hart of a godly woman, who from time to time aduertiſed the faithful ones of all their whole deuiſes, ſo that they continually put themſelues in armes, before their ſecret enemies could bring any part of their enterpriſe to paſſe, and it was ſo wiſely and diſcreetly handeled, as that they thought it to bee done vpon ſome other occaſion: which cauſed the diſſemblers and counterfets, not once dare to take in hande that theyr deuiſe, by reaſon they were inwardly ſtricken with ſhame and feare.</p>
            <p>There were certaine alſo, which came the very ſame time to Peter Adryanſon the Burrough maſter, ſhewing him both by lamentable &amp; threatning words, of their pouertie &amp; hunger, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that they ſhould thereby moue him to ſeeke ſome meanes to agree with the enemie. Howbeit, he in theſe few wordes anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them, and ſaid: My good friends, &amp; beloued fellow citizens, I haue made an oth, which by the grace of god, I meane conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to keep: If my death, ſith I am ſure I muſt once die, may any way pleaſure you, it is all one to me, whether you or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enemie kill mee: for, for mine owne part, I intend (god willing) to go on a plaine &amp; direct courſe: &amp; therfore, if this carkaſſe of mine will do you any good, in gods name take it, cut it in peeces, &amp; deuide it as farre as may poſſibly ſtretch, for I ſhalbe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented therwith.

            <p>Although the Citizens of Leyden had conceiued ſome good hope for their deliuerance, as well by the letters fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Eſtates the twelfth of that moneth, as alſo by the hearing and ſeeing of the effect of the great ordenance: yet becauſe they had not long before that, neither receiued or yet ſent any letters, by reaſon of the great war de that was about the Towne, they ſent two meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, who arriued the 26. of September about the Admyral: to declare vnto him the extreeme neceſſitie of the Citizens, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che was in deed very great, but yet not ſo great as they ſaid: and alſo to ſee the eſtate of the armie, whereof they themſelues, if it were poſſible, ſhould come back to make report to their fellowe Citizens, if not, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> then they ſhould ſend letters by the poſts of the ayre: for to that end, had the meſſengers aforeſaide, carried with them ſixe old doues.</p>
            <p>Nowe, as the meſſengers thought to returne towardes the Towne with the Admirals letters, they founde all the paſſages belaid, and therefore were driuen of neceſſitie to returne: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the Admir all Boyſot,
<note place="margin">Neceſſitie, the inuentrix of a cunning policie</note> had ſent his letters the 27. of Septe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber by a flying poſte, hauing written to the townes men, that by the grace of God, he would procure their ayde and deliuerance, praying them to remaine conſtant, &amp; not lightly and vnaduiſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receiue in any victuals, without they ſaw himſelfe, or ſome aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance from him, for he feared that the Spaniardes vnder his name might by ſome ſtratageme abuſe and deceiue them.
<note place="margin">A flying meſſen ger arriueth at Leyden.</note> The firſt flying meſſenger, arriued at Leyden the 28. of that moneth, which the magiſtrate by ſound of the bel, gaue the people to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, &amp; the 29. day he read y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> letters ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly.

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:11838:134"/>done, made their prayers vnto the Lorde.</p>
            <p>Now, this great ioy, was not without ſome mixture of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe, becauſe that before, and the ſame very day, the winde blew vp at the Northeaſt, which cauſed the water to fall rather then ryſe: ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the princes armie thought, that they had as it were loſt all hope of deliuering them, if the inuiſible meanes of God, to wit, the great flowing of the water, which began that 29. day, &amp; laſted vntill the ſecond of October, had not holpen them. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Admirall Boyſot, wrote vnto his Excellencie, that if God of his mercy did not help both w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wind &amp; alſo with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> riſing of the water, and by ſuche meanes as no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was able as yet to perceiue, that he ſawe not which way poſſible to bring to paſſe the reuictualling of the towne for this time, and feared that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it woulde be too late: conſidering that there was not a beaſte left, and that there were but two diſſributions moe to be had, and theſe, but to laſt for right dayes. Inſomuch that the miſery (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the peſtilence, diſeaſes, and diſcord) was in the towne verie great as he vnderſtood by the meſſengers: and as was alſo after found to be moſt true.</p>
            <p>For many of them had not in ſeuen weekes ſpace, eaten one byt of bread, &amp; drunke nothing els but water. Horſe fleſh alſo was then as good meat with the wealthieſt of them, as mutton is at this preſent. Cats and dogs amongſt the aduenturers,

It is impoſſible to deſcribe vnto you all their maner of cookery, although many tolde mee of it. Some of them eate vine leaues mingled with Amell floure and ſalt. There was great difference in the leaues of trees, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they made ſundrie kindes of meates of leeke blades, rootes and roote ſtalkes, and the roote leaues which fell to the ground, was a very ordinary kinde of good meate. Rootes and ſkinnes cut in ſmall gobbins, and ſodden in butter mylke, was an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and common meate for manie. Gentlewomen were driuen to eate their little pupprelles, in whom before they tooke great pleaſure. To the place where the fleſh was wonced to be cut out and diuided, the poore children came, and eate blood rawe, the peeces of the fleſh which fell away in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diuiſion. All the old rotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhoes in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> towne, which lay in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dirt, were take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp, &amp; eate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> forthw<hi rend="sup">t</hi>.
<pb facs="tcp:11838:135"/>The Poore women were ſeene ſitting vpon the dounghils, with their clokes caſt ouer their heads, gathering vp of the beſt bones they coulde finde, and carryed them home to their houſes. And they no ſooner founde the leaſt ſtalk of a roote, but that they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately eate it vp. The young boyes oftentimes ſucked the bones, which the dogs had gnawne. Euery woman that lay in childbed, was fain to be pleaſed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a quarter of a pound of biſket a day. Some women againe were ſo honger bitten, as that the childe in theyr wombe was almoſt pined to death.

A pound of butter was worth xv. ſouls. A yellow carot one ſouls, a rootſtalk halfe a ſouls, a Peare or Apple a grote. There was offered for a ſacke of wheate an hundred florins.</p>
            <p>Ouer and beſides this great miſery, the plague was ſo ryfe all the Towne ouer, as that there dyed of it almoſt ſixe thouſand perſons. The young children which were ſtaruen to death, ſaid, as it is written in the lamentations of Ieremie: Where is the bread, where is the wine, and ſo fell down ſtark dead in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtreetes or betweene their mothers armes:
<note place="margin">The inſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table calamitie and miſerie of the Leydeus.</note> and therefore after that, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny young children were faine to eate horſe fleſh. The men which could ſcarſcely go ouer the bridge, were enforced to ward as good as naked, and in their returne, founde neither wife nor children aliue. They y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were wont to goe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their dizaines to the warde, came backe againe with eight, ſixe, and ſometimes three. Noble women and their children which were wont to be clad in ſilkes and fed vppon the moſt delicate meates, dyed of very hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
            <p>There was a dead man brought, and layde before the gate of the Buroughmaſters, thereby to ſhewe hym (as it was thought) both cloſely and expreſly, that hee had beene the cauſe thereof, &amp; therfore y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it apperteined to him to ſeeke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mean to preuent it.</p>
            <pb n="131" facs="tcp:11838:135"/>
            <p>To bee ſhort, the extreeme miſerie in the Towne was ſuch, as is impoſſible for mee to deſcribe and ſet downe. But they who, after the deliuerance thereof, had ſeene their leane faces, and ſmall and feeble legges, might eaſily haue witneſſed the ſame.</p>
            <p>And now to returne againe vnto the Princes armie, it had not needed to haue tarryed long at Norta, if it had beene certainelie knowne, that the Leydens coulde haue held out longer time. Againe, the Prince and chiefe rulers of the armie, knewe right well, that the neerer Winter drewe on, the greater abundaunce of water woulde enſue. And the generall of the armie knewe well enough alſo, that hee muſt paſſe betweene Soeterwood, &amp; Suyten houſe, and ſo did the enemie likewiſe, and therefore had eſpecially placed his whole warde there. In the meane while many thought it beſt, to attempt by night Soetermeir Meere way, towardes Stompwyke way, but it was to no purpoſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that all the ditches and chanels lay in and out crokedlie: &amp; beſides, the Spaniard alſo warded there. The Papiſts aforeſaid, had lying vpon the Rhyin, fiue great gallies, and well appointed boates, howbeit they wanted maryners.</p>
            <p>As theſe thinges in this wiſe moſt lamentablie ſtoode, the moſt mightie God and Lord of Hoſtes, who on extreeme ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie neuer forſaketh his, hauing compaſſion on his miſerable afflicted ones, woulde needes ſhe we foorth his ſtrong and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtretched arme, for the deliuerie of his deſolate people out of the hands of a Tyrant.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, he ſent the windes his Miniſters,

For beſides, the great ouerſlowing of the waters, the Northeaſt winde wonderfull violently blewe vp, and brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine the fallen water vpon the face of the earth: who ſo proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Southeaſt winde, as that it draue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame water towards Leyden: Inſomuch, that the Princes armie, which before, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boueſaid, had but niene ynches of water, had then aboue two feet and an halfe, and was able to paſſe euen at the firſt, ouer the high fieldes, vnto Ryrkweigh aforeſaid, &amp; if at any time they ſaw the water faile the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then would ten or twelue men goe out of euery ſhip, and ſo lighten her, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe might flote, &amp; afterward paſſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

            <p>The order of this armie of the princes by Sea,
<note place="margin">The order of the princes armie at Sea.</note> paſſing ouer the ſaid high Territorie, was ranged &amp; placed in maner as follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth. The Admiralles of Fluſhing &amp; Zierickſea, had followyng ech of them fifceene gallies, which ſpred themſelues abrode like two winges. And firſt, Admirall Boyſot accompanied with the Colonell of the guard, had the leading of the left wing, on Soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwood ſide, becauſe it was thought that the greateſt force of the enemie lay there: The Admiral of Zerickſea had in his company maſter Citadell, Bultran, captaine Paule Duyrant and others. The vice Admirall was placed on the right ſide of Suyten, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the Baron of Noieles, maſter Cornes &amp; Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chart, and with Captaines, Henrie &amp; Grenu. Philip de Aſſeliers, maſter of the ordenance, and warlike munitions, was appointed to tarry with the great ordenance, &amp; eight or ten gallies vppon Norta, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> keeping of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> victuals, vntil ſuch time as the ſaid ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals had gotten Ryrkweigh aforeſaid, &amp; that then hee ſhoulde follow, and brauely ſalute the Soeterwoodens with the greate ordenance, which ordenance was charged with pretie little bags ſtuffed full of leaden bullets, to wit. 300. in euery bagge finely and artificially couched, and thoſe to be diſpearſed amongeſt the thickeſt of the enemie.</p>
            <p>When all things were thus orderly arranged &amp; placed, the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie departed about midnight, the day aforeſaid, and the Gallies and ſhips were ſeuered an harquebuze ſhot one behind another, hauing in the middeſt about eighteene or twentie Barkes laden with Pyoners, and all kindes of tooles for entrenching, to the ende they myght ſo ſoone as it was poſſible, fortifie themſe lues at the ſaid Church way. But the Spaniardes had appointed ſo great a watch in their ſmall veſſels, as that it might haue ſerued for the whole bodie of a ward. And when they ſaw the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſomewhat neere, they called aloud, and ſaid: Who is there, who is there, but not a worde was giuen them, vntill ſuche tyme as the Admyrall was gotten within Gun ſhot: and then he ſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted them with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> roaring and thundring of the Canon, as that
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:11838:136"/>the night ſeemed to bee day.</p>
            <p>This watch anſwered them againe with caliuers, muſkets, and certaine faulconet ſhot, and then left their veſſels, &amp; by little and little retyred, ſtill playing with their ſmall ſhot, vntill they had goten to the body of their ward, which was entrenched at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery corner of the way. Then ſalied they brauely out on euerie ſide, fiercely deliuering their muſkets againſt the Orengia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: but the Zealanders ſo reſaluted them with ſuch on haile of Bullets, as that they were driuen with great loſſe to retyre to their tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, leauing there behinde them, onely a few ſouldiers to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the ſkirmiſh: who ſoone after alſo made their retrait:

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the Spaniards.</note> for the French Captaines, the captaine of the guard, Bultran, and Bourchart went on land, and entrenched themſelues on Soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwood ſide, and Grenu, Ladriere, and others on the right ſide. In the mean while y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were quietly entrenching of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues before the day breake, the Zealanders plaied fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their ſhips with their canons vpon the Soeterwoodens, but chiefly where they ſaw any fire or light, and ſhot fier alſo, into ſome of their houſes. The Maryners &amp; french ſouldiers which were on land, caſt fier likewiſe into diuers of their houſes. The captaines aforeſaid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning on both ſides from the ſkirmiſhe ſtucke thicke into the grounde all alongſt the way ſtakes with long yron pykes at the ende of them, to the end y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the enemie being once driuen from that way might neuer returne thither againe.</p>
            <p>Now when the Orengians had taken this Churche way, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched themſelues, &amp; placed a ward there: they gawged it in three places, to make a way for the paſſing of their gallies: In the mean while, the ſhips laden with victuals being about an hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, were ſent away, and arriued all neere the armie, two excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which going out of the right way, fell on the dry land, and ſo conſequently into the handes of the enemie. And ſurely, here is one thing greatly to be conſidered of, that in the feates and deedes of armes of ſo great importance, doone in the ſight and middeſt of the whole force of the enemie, there were not aboue fiue or ſixe men of the Princes ſide ſlaine: But to ſay truly, this was Gods worke and not mans, for the good GOD when it pleaſeth hym, keepeth and defendeth his, euen in the greateſt and moſt perillous dangers, to the ende hee woulde ſhewe vnto
<pb facs="tcp:11838:137"/>Tyrants and proude men, that hee is able to abaſe and throwe downe the power and ſtrength, whereof they ſo highly bragge, that thereby he might make his glory, magnificence, and prayſe, appeare the greater.</p>
            <p>When all the whole armie by Sea, and victuallers, had paſſed that way: The Admirall of Fluſhing directed his courſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the meere bridge: Neuertheleſſe, after he had ſayled a little way, where he thought to haue found it deepeſt, it proued very ſhallow.</p>
            <p>And then, the Zealanders ſhewed themſelues to bee men of great ſtomacke, for they, for the vnburdening of theyr ſhips leapt preſently into the water, and like men that had rather haue car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried theyr veſſels away vpon theyr ſhoulders, then to haue leaft them, by that meanes got to Meerbrough.</p>
            <p>When the Spaniardes and the reſt which lay encamped about Soeterwood Church in diuers Trenches, had ſeene the next day in the morning which was the ſecond of October, that the Prince his armie had not as yet directed her courſe towards Leyden, thought that becauſe they ſaw all on a light fier behinde them, that they meant to encloſe them in Soeterwood. And that which moſt of all amazed them, was, that they ſawe the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in ſo ſhort time ryſen ſo high:
<note place="margin">Baldes and his companie take a faire paire of heeles.</note> And therefore Baldez, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall of their campe, conſidering, what aduantage the Orenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, nowe had, began to quaile, and with ſuch ſpeed left Soeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, as that hee had not the leaſure to carry away his great or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denance with him. Howbeit, hee was no ſooner fled, but that Alfonſe Loupes Gallio, folowed him with his ſeuen Enſignes, and tooke the way from Forſcote, through a place, whiche hee had for that purpoſe cauſed to be heightened with boughes and fagots.</p>
            <p>When the Admyral and his retinue, were in Meirbrough he vnderſtood nothing of this flight, vntill it was too late: and that the greater number of them were gotten away. Howbeit cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Gallies cutting the way off from them, ſo brauely played with the great ordenance amongeſt the luſtie heele lifters, as that a good manie of them were driuen to returne: who beeing thus ſcattered one from another, the Zealanders
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:11838:137"/>thereupon, getting out of the water, fell vpon the tayle of thoſe which fledde towardes Forſcote, and with their long ruſty pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, ſlew euery mothers ſonne of them, and ſo luſtely purſued them, as that many of the Enemies running directly before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not knowing they way, drowned themſelues in the ditches and channelles.</p>
            <p>The reſt, which could not gette to Foreſcote, for feare of the great Ordenaunce of the Gallyes, which had cut the waye off from them, fled towardes Stompwyke way, and caſting their weapons farinough from them, tooke their heeles towards Leyerdam and Forebrough. In this flight, and with the batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that was the night before, about 200. of Baldez ſouldiers, were pretely well cooled.</p>
            <p>There were alſo certeine Barkes taken, laden with Baldez wine, victualles, and baggage, which were deliuered to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall. But here is a thing greatly to be conſidered of, that notwithſtanding that the Lord God, what by reaſon of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great ouerflowiug of the waters, as alſo becauſe of the good counſell which he inſpired into them, had mightely aſſiſted the Orengers, wherby they might vſe the fitteſt meanes for this purpoſe, yet had all this beene euen as good as nothing, ſeeing that the great numbers of the Enemy, and their fortes, ſeemed to be inuinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if ſo be that he had not mightily feared and aſtoniſhed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For euen at that very inſtant, ſuch a great feare came vppon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that laye at Leyerthorpe and Lammen, as that they trembled withal, to ſee their companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s thus flye: and although the church and houſes of Soeterwood, were all on a light fier, yet they which lay at Lammen, thought it beſt, not once to ſtirre one ſtep from thence.</p>
            <p>But to returne nowe againe to the Leydens, it hath here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore beene ſayde, That the Meſſengers whiche came fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to the Princes Nauy, brought Doues with them, one of which was ſent backe againe, who faythfully carryed ouer her Letters: and beſide, the Leydens looked for none other newes nor aduertiſments, but when they ſhould iſſue out of the Town, to ſet vpon the fort and trench of Lammen: which thing was written vnto them the firſt of October, howbeit, the flying poſte did not her duetie, but was the firſt, that came the next daye to

Howbeit, when the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens ſaw the fier at Soeterwood, but eſpecially the Church, to be on a light fier, knowing right well that the Spaniardes laye there, and were rounde about well fortified in their trenches, they all merueilous ioyfully leaped vpon the Rampars, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Enemies being welfortified in Lammen fort, the Cannon playing brauely from the trench againſt the Oren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers Army: and beſides, their ſeeing in the afternoone 300. ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers at Tronſtone, decayed houſe: Wherefore they caryed their Enſignes to the Rampars, and tyed them to the Wynde mylles ſayles, in token that they were of good courage, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.

            <p>The Spanyardes merueilouſly played with their great or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denaunce agaynſt the Orengers army, both from Lammen fort, and alſo from Iames Nycholſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s forte at Wedde: ſo that they ſlew with one Cannon ſhotte ſeauen of the Admyrals men at a blowe, making thereby, the worlde beleeue that they were fully determined to keepe the ſayde fortes.

<note place="margin">The ſcituation of Lammen fort</note> which the Princes peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple moſt feared, by reaſon it ſtoode on the hyer grounde, I haue thought good to make ſome ſmall diſcription of the ſcituatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thereof.</p>
            <p>This place ſtandeth in a playne fielde, hauing no hye ground nor hilles about it, and all the Channelles and ſtreames were quite and cleane dammed vp, about a quarter of a myle from the Towne.

            <p>The Rampare of this Trench was reaſonably thicke, but yet not able to hould out the Cannon ſhot: It was alſo well furniſhed with great Ordenaunce, ſouldiers, &amp; with what ſoeuer els neceſſary for a Trenche, ſo that (in any mans reaſon) if the Spanyardes had wel kept this one onely Trench, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Oren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers Armye had neuer beene able to haue paſſed, without the great loſſe of men.

<pb facs="tcp:11838:139"/>to ſee where he might, to the moſt aduauntage plant his Orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce, where they found, that they might plante two demye Cannons at the corner of a channel, but not without great paine and perrill.</p>
            <p>This night, the Admirall wrote to his Excellency, of all this ſituation aforeſayd, and withall, how he meant the next morrow to batter it. But if ſo be the thing fel not out as he looked for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he would be contenced, vntill ſuch time as the water ſhould waxe deepe, that it might be nauigable on the one ſide ouer their land. And although his Excellency, had committed the whole dealing hereof into the handes of God, yet theſe newes, pleaſed him no whit, but greatly doubted of the deliueraunce of Leyden, aſwell becauſe of the reaſons aforeſaid, as alſo for that he feared, there could be no ſufficient breach made, to giue the aſſault, conſidering with all the fewneſſe of his men. Howbeit the Lord of hoſtes would alone prouide for all theſe difficulties, and ſmall hope, and giue the honour to his moſt mightie Arme, to the ende, men might vnderſtand, that although they knew many practiſes, for the vanquiſhing of the Enemy, yet, that all ſhould be in vaine, &amp; to no purpoſe, without he put to his helping hand, and the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, to come from him alone.</p>
            <p>For, after that the two Admiralles, the third of October had very early in the morning layed open the channelles, which were merueilouſly choked vp with great ſtakes and pyles, for the planting (as before hath been ſaid, of their artillary, and bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of Lammen fort, they perceiued that the Lord God had preuented them, and would not haue the Enemy driuen awaye by the force of men.

Howbeit there was neuer a man, eyther without, or yet within the Town that once vnderſtood of this flight and retraicte: although in very deede, a great noyſe was heard in the night, as they ſoonke a great peece of Ordenaunce, in the channell right before the ſaid fort: Neuertheleſſe, there was a young ſtripling, who wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching that night on the Rampare, ſaw many light matches goe out of the Forte, and none returne againe: And therfore he preſumed</p>

            <p>When hee was come to the forte, and found neuer a man there he wayued with his cappe, but yet for all this the Townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men beleeued him not becauſe they doubted, that the Spaniard by ſome ſleight had ſo commaunded him: Neuertheleſſe, when they ſawe, that an other which followed him paſſed before the forte towardes the Admyrall, wading vp to the knees; to ſalute him, great ioy and myrth was made on euery ſide. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon the valyaunt Captayne Gerard Lane, tooke his way with his Aduenturers towardes Lammen forte, vntyl he came to the firſt place that was ſtrengthened with pyles, where he receiued with great ioye the Admyralles two firſt Gallyes. For the Admyrall being a man of iudgement, and not light of beeliefe, hadde ſente theſe two Gallyes before, which founde all to bee true, that was coulde him: to wytte, that they had left the Forte, and ſoonke two great peeces of Ordenaunce in the Channell.</p>
            <p>After that the paſſages were layde open,
<note place="margin">The Admirall Boyſot entreth Leyden.</note> and cleared of the pyles, the Admyrall Lewys Boyſot, ioyfully prayſing GOD, made out the Vauntguarde towardes Leyden, where hee quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye entred at eyght of the clocke in the morning.</p>
            <p>And Adryan Guyllanne the Admyral of zierickſea ledde the Rerewarde. But it was a lamentable thing to ſee, the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſtarued people deuoure the rawe Herringes, which the Admyrall at his entrie, caſt vnto the people: and likewiſe the breade, whereof, ſome of them eate ſo greedely, as if they ſhoulde neuer haue beene filled: Whereupon, many of them which ſo fed, ſurfeited, and by litle and litle, great numbers died thereof.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide of the Towne, towards Harlem Meere, were three Gallyes of Amſterdam, who nowe and then ſaluted the Towne with the Cannon: But when they perceyued the ayde, and with all the Artyllarye of the Towne, they were
<pb facs="tcp:11838:140"/>ſo heartily afeard, as that they parte awaye with all their whole company.</p>
            <p>When the Admyrals were in the Towne, they with theyr retynue, and Citizens, went to the Church, to thanke God with all their heartes, for his laying vnder the water, the fieldes, and drye lande, and conducting of them to the deſiered place and porte.</p>
            <p>Baldes his people, who the day before forſooke their fortes, had fiered Soeterwood but chiefly Weyporte, and being ſtriken with feare, forſooke alſo the third of October, their Cabyns, without burning of them, but eſpecially the forte of Leyerthorp, and all thereabout. For although they were aboue three, to one Orenger,
<note place="margin">The number of the Orengers ſoldiers &amp; mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, is not in al aboue 1500. men.</note> who when they were altogether, were not both of ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, maryners, and others which bare Armes, beſides thoſe whiche had the leading of the vitcualles, aboue two thouſande fiue hundred, whereas Baldez men, after their own reckoning, were, betwixt eleauen and niene thouſand at leaſt, as alſo may verye well appeare by their Letters aboue mentioned: But the Almighty God, as before hath beene ſayde, for the deliuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of his people, ſtrooke them with a merueilous great terror, as he in olde time ſtroke Senacherib, for the deliuerye of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Iſrael. And I thinke, that if the Hiſpaniolized. Leydens, woulde confeſſe the trueth (as ſome of them haue already done at Leyerthorpe) they woulde teſtifie that feare was the cauſe. For the Orengers are not aſhamed, for their partes to confeſſe, that if their hope and confidence had not been in an inuiſible ayde, and that they before hand ſawe, that thing, which now they ſee, to wit, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Towne being on euery ſide encompaſſed, with ſo manye Trenches and Bulwarkes, as that it was vnlikely that they euer once durſt haue attempted, to reuictuall and ſuccour the Towne with ſo fewe people. But the Lorde God would needes ſhewe his mightie hand, and ſtretched out arme, to the end that all glory might be giuen to his heauenly wiſdome and goodneſſe.</p>
            <p>And wee are not here to forget a very great and meruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous accident, to wit, that the ſelfe ſame night, wherein the Spanyarde forſooke the Forte of Lammen, there fell downe a pane of the wall, and vauntmure of the Towne, betweene the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:11838:140"/>Cow gate and Bourgoine Tower, ſixe and twentie Poles longe, ſo that there was a breache made without any batterye. If the Enemye had had this aduauntage before, to wit, two or three nightes before, when as they thought, in the night, by ſcale, to haue ſurpriſed the Town at Hoogewoert Gate, which they ſcaled, and thought to haue wonne, becauſe a fonde younge Wench had giuen them to vnderſtande, that the watch was very ſmall: Howbeit, they founde it otherwiſe. For, before ſuch time as three Harquebouzes were diſcharged, they all retyered: No doubt of it, they might haue thought the ſame, to bee as woonderfull a thing, as the Citizens nowe make of this, hurte and feare onelye excepted, becauſe that theyr breache was made without batterye: But it pleaſed the Lorde GOD to deale otherwiſe with the Citizens: for they, in ſteede of takinge of harme, receiued benefit. For, the great noyſe was it, that encreaſed the feare of the Enemye, by reaſon they thought, that the Citizens had ſalied out of the Towne, to charge them in the face, and the Orengers on the backe, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had the Townſmen ſo much the more cauſe to prayſe the Lord.</p>
            <p>When the Admyrall was come to Leyden, hee forthwith wrote to his Excellencye ſying at Delft, how that God had ſtriken the Enemy with ſuch an horrible feare, as that they hadde forſaken the fort of Lammen, which was the cauſe of his entrye into the Towne.</p>
            <p>This Letter was caryed to his Excellency the 3. of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and deliuered vnto him at two of the clock in the afternoon, being at the Sermon, which without all doubt, were other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of newes then that came in the morning: Wherefore, ſo ſoone as the French Sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s were finiſhed, he cauſed the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, openly to reade the Letter, moſt thankfully and ioyfully prayſing the Lord. The like alſo was done at the 2. great chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, ſo that theſe newes were ioyfully ſpred all ouer, in a verye great Company and Congregation of the people, and in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies preſence. The ſame alſo was done in the reſt of the Towns of Holland, with bonſters, and ſuch like tokens of ioye.</p>
            <p>After that the Admyrals had thus victualled the Towne of Leyden, thanked and prayſed the lord of his grace, encouraged y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:11838:141"/>Cytizens, and filled them with meate, they purſued the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torye, and fell vppon the Enemye that laye entrenched about Leyerthorpe.</p>
            <p>The Trenche at Leyerthorpe was wonderfull ſtronge, and they which lay there greatly bragged, and tolde the meſſengers which came thyther, of their merueilous force, which tended, as it nowe fell out, to their greater ſhame, and the Lordes far greater honour: and more villanouſly forſooke the Fortes and Trenches of Haye, and the Oldwatring, where they had remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a full yeare and a daye. For a very ſmall number of the Princes Vauntcurrers, which, as it is ſayde was not aboue a doſen, put two of the Enemies Enſignes to flight: ſome of which fled with ſuch ſpeede, as that they ceaſed not running vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they came to the gates of Amſterdame, ſaying, in their own excuſe, that all the whole Campe was diſcomfited and put to flight. At the ſame time likewiſe, did Baldez his people forſake, not onely Gaude ſcluſe Trenches, but alſo all the reſt, to the number of two and twentie, ſaue Wadding alone, where remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned certeine ſouldiers for the freeing of the paſſage. Nowe, in this voyage and expedition, there were no moe of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces parte ſlaine, then fortie, but of the Enemies, by theyr own confeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, aboue a thouſand. Howbeit, here is one thing not to be forgotten, which the ſayde Baldez lefte in his Lodginge, to wit, the Towne of Leyden pyctured, with all her royall wayes, pathes, and Channelles of water, and all in ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as they were guarded, and defended with fortes. And when he was enforced to rayſe his Campe,
<note place="margin">A few Lattin words written by Baldes.</note> he wrote vnder this Pyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: <hi>Vale Ciuitas, valete Caſtelli parui, Quia relicti eſtis propter aquam, &amp; non per vim Inimicorum.</hi> That is to ſaye, Farewell Leyden, and all the ſmall Caſtelles about thee, for the Waters haue dryuen vs out of you, and not the force of the Enemy.</p>
            <p>I confeſſe in deede, that the waters were one of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall meanes to cauſe Baldes leaue the Town and Trenches: But if he woulde haue ſpoken truely, he ſhould haue ſayde: It is the myghtye and ſtrong arme of the Lorde which hath enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced me to leaue you, who hath put me in ſuch a terryble feare, as that Antiochus, neuer fledd out of Perſia with greater

            <p>When his Excellency had heard of the foreſaide newes,

               </note> he went the next day to <hi>Leyden,</hi> giuing the citizens great thanks, both for their fidelity, and alſo for their ſo valiantly defending of themſelues without ſouldiers, againſt ſo populous an enemy, and therefore told them, that both they and their children ſhould be well rewarded for their great trauell. And afterward, he ſet an order in euery thing, as wel about y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> affaires of the Towne, as of the warres, to the end he might make his profit of the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, which the Lord had giuen him.</p>
            <p>Howbeit for the greater manifeſtation of the wonderful works of GOD, I haue one thing more heere to ſpeake of whiche is not to be paſſed ouer in ſilence, and that is this, that the foure of October the winde being then at the Southeaſt, &amp; the next <hi>3.</hi> or <hi>4.</hi> daies following, ſo luſtely blowing vp at the Northeaſt, as that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without great danger, was able to paſte fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Delft to <hi>Leyden,</hi> becauſe the water as faſt as was poſſible left y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fields, and returned againe to Sea.</p>
            <p>Ouer and beſides the victuals aforeſaid, which were brought to <hi>Leyden,</hi> his Excellency, and his counſel thought it good, that all the reſt of the Townes round there about, ſhould ayde and aſſiſt the poore famiſhed <hi>Leydens,</hi> to the ende that the miſerable ſoules who had ſo long time got nothing, but conſumed al their moueable goodes might be holpen, and ſo the rich mens vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals thereby laſt the longer.</p>
            <p>For which cauſe, the deputies of <hi>Delft,</hi> went all <hi>Delft</hi> through with their Waggons and Boates, gathering amongeſt the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, great ſtore of Bread, Butter, Fleſh, Cheeſe, Lard, Fiſh, and money, to the value of a <hi>1000.</hi> Florins and better. Which did not onely mightely helpe the poore, but alſo ſo eaſed the rich as that the Towne was therby likewiſe reuictualled, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed not only a farre greater amity, betweene the Townes, but confirmed alſo their alliance, a great deale the more.</p>
            <p>And although al the world knoweth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> not only this warre of <hi>Leyden,</hi> but alſo of the whole low countries, was taken in hand,
<pb facs="tcp:11838:142"/>partely for the defence of the lybertie of the Countrey, yet ſhall it better appeare by certeine peeces of Artillary, which the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of the lybertie of it, had cauſed to be made, to the vtter abolyſhing of the whole libertie thereof, as by the manner of it euen very nowe, we ſhall vnderſtande. For, the Leydens bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus diſtreſſed about the lybertie of the ſame, and in the ende delyuered, founde the verye ſame daye of their lybertye and delyueraunce, a very great peece of Ordenaunce, named the Lybertie, which the Spanyardes had ſoonke in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of the Channell. The Lord therfore graunt them, that they may with all preſerue the libertie of their Country, and vſe it to his glory.</p>
            <p>The <hi>8.</hi> of October, his Excellency departed from Leyden to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes Haye, where be tooke order, if it were poſſible, for the conſeruation and holding of the place, as the onely key of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem Meere.</p>
            <p>The <hi>9.</hi> day his Excellency went to Gaude ſcluſe, about the ordering of all thinges neceſſary there, where was a very ſtrong Trench: But by reaſon of the daungerous diſeaſe which his hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghneſſe had at Roterodam, the Spaniards preſumed, that the warre was made in his name being dead: and therefore two Spaniardes were ſent to Leyden with Paſſeport from Iulyan Romero, to ſee if he were aliue: and if they found him ſo, that they ſhould talke with his Excellency about the deliuery of M. S. Aldegonde, in exchaung of Colonnell Mondragon, whereupon they agreed: and when his Excellency had diſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched their Paſſeporte and Letters, hee within two houres after, ſent them away. And after that his Excellency, for the cauſes aboueſayde ſuffyciently ſet down, had chaunged the great coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of Leyden,

            <p>A litle while after, that the ſayde Baldez was come to Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, he dayly lamented and bewayled his great miſhappe: For there beganne a great vprore amongſt his ſouldiers, and they mortally hated him, and gaue it openly out, that he had dealte

When Ferdinando Lopes ſee how this geare fell out, he ranne into a Hog ſtie in a Bakers houſe to ſaue himſelf: And his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers pulde their Enſigne from the ſtaffe, and teare it all in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ioyned with the twoo Enſignes of Loſy and Villers, and ſweare that thei would with al their hartes, and in very deede liue and dye with them. And afterward, thei went all together to the Colonell his lodgyng with a greate Alarme, biddyng hym come out. The Colonell beeyng greatly amazed with this trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and noyſe, came to the gate, and with his hatte in his hande, ſaied louyngly vnto theim: My beloued and faithfull Souldiers, content your ſelues, and tell me what it is that you would haue: And if it bee money, I promiſe you that you ſhall haue it within this three daies, vſyng theſe and many other ſuche like woordes vnto them.</p>

After this, thei went to the Brake where thei were wonted to bee tortured and corrected when thei had miſuſed them ſelues, or committed any offence, and there with Harquebouze ſhotte and Hatchettes thei beate doune and cut in ſunder the cordes and inſtrumentes, wherewith the Strappado was giuen them, and cariyng them to the Market place, ſet them on fire, and cried with a loude voyce and luſtie courage.</p>

            <p>This being doen, the Souldiers went to the Prouoſts houſe, or Deputie for the Eſtates of the lowe Countreis, named Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Martini Stella, whom the Colonell hymſelf had tortured,

            <p>When thei had this doen, thei ſent 50. Souldiers to Seigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Fafcus lodgyng the Spanyarde, Colonell of Zurphen:

How beit, thei could not finde hym, becauſe

<pb facs="tcp:11838:165"/>the zeale and deſire of the Lordes of the Eſtates aboue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, was not as yet throughly ſatiſfied.

And this maie eaſely appeare in the newe infringyng of the Priuiledges, euen by the iniuſte detainyng of the Countie Buren, who, in the open ſight of all men, was, contrary to lawe, reaſon, and the Priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Countrey carried cleane awaie: Whiche ought ſo muche the more to bee conſidered of, ſeyng that the ſaied Priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges in ſo iollie a beginnyng and treatie, which ſhould expreſly haue tended to the confirmation and aduauncyng of theim, are thereby, deminiſſhed and leſſoned in a perticuler perſone that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer offended, whiche dealyng, offereth ſmall hope, of obſeruyng the Priuiledges with the people, and Cities, in generall, when as, euery light occaſion will eaſely bee made rebellion, and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt theim. And beſides, euery man, that will not bee wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully blinde, faieth, that the laſte pacification made at Gaunt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the cauſes aforeſaied, is broken, the infringyng whereof, is the verie breake necke of all together, and therefore it is euident, wherevnto the ſaied Articles tende, becauſe, the allowyng and ratefiyng of the ſaied pacification, is not ſo clearely and perfectly made, as the weightineſſe of ſuche a thyng requireth, but whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hangeth, vpon certaine reſtraintes and interpretations, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on maie enſue muche deceipte, and craftie dealyng, conſideryug, that the Articles are altogether like vnto thoſe, whiche in the tyme of the Ducheſſe of Parma, were the cauſes of ſuche an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible effuſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of blood: Againſt whiche, the Deputies of the Prince of Drenge, and the Eſtates of Hollande and Sealande, made o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen proteſtation, and cauſed alſo, a publicque Acte, bothe of their acceptation, and alſo of the Counſaile of Eſtate to bee likewiſe made.</p>

Laſtly, it is not to be founde in the ſaied Articles, that any aſſuraunce is graunted vnto the Enhabitauntes of Holland and Sealand, ſithe that at the treatie of Breda, thei had a more fitt and reaſonable of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer made them: Whiche thyng thei alſo in the ende, greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at the pacification of Gant, had it not been that their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties declared bothe by mouthe and writyng, that thei would in no wiſe treate with any other, then with the ſaied Eſtates, ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyng thereby, how roundly on their behalfe, thei then proceeded. Proteſtyng, that if ſo thei meant to receiue Don Ihon of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriche, and deale with hym in ſuche ſorte as now thei haue, that thei would haue demaunded an other maner of aſſuraunce, as in very deede, thei had good occaſion. And beſides, that as there was no mention made in theſe Articles for their ſafetie and aſſurance, no more alſo was there any forwardnes of any matter ſet doune, wherby, any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould be reſtored to his goodes, poſſeſſions, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, &amp; Gouernement, as in many other places, both in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treis there aboutes, and alſo in the Countie of Burgondy it was, whiche notwithſtandyng, accordyng to the pacification (the ſame point in the ſaid treatie, which the generall Eſtates at that tyme,
<pb facs="tcp:11838:166"/>could not bee expreſly declared) ought to haue beene conditioned and couenaunted. Moreouer, neither could there be any aſſurance perceiued to bee made, for the reſt of the Countreis and Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, nor yet for the poore Commonaltie of the ſame. For, there was no mention at all therein made, about the pullyng doune of the Cytadelles or Caſtles, by reaſon of whiche, as all men well enough know, proceeded many miſchiefes: neither yet any plaine declaration of the forgettyng and forgiuyng of that, that was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie paſſed, no, nor yet of that, whereof mention is made in the ſaied Articles: whiche dealyng, made the people very ſuſpicious, becauſe, that thei beyng openly threatned in the laſt Aſſemble at Huy, ought to haue beene well aſſured for the tyme to come, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng the Countrey was vnarmed, and Don Ihon of Auſtriche appointed to be Gouernour: conſideryng alſo there with, that the former examples plainely enough ſhewed the ſequele of ſome ſuche like thyng. And againe, it ſeemed that for this tyme, thei meant to ioyne him onely with the generall Eſtates, but as ioynt Gouernours, that thei might thereby, depriue the people of all meanes, wherewith, hereafter to be able, to aſſure them ſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ill will of hym, whom thei entended to appoinct ouer them, as Gouernour. To bee ſhorte, there were yet many moe poinctes, whiche the Princes, and the Eſtates of Hollande and Sealande, thought neceſſarie to be well weighed and conſidered of: and therefore euery of them meant to ſet doune the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulerly by them ſelues, in writyng, and ſende them to the Lords of the Eſtates, declaryng vnto them, that the Prince and Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of Hollande and Sealande were fully perſwaded, that it was now high tyme, to followe the examples of our Predeceſſors, to the ende, that the Priuiledges, Lawes, and Franchiſes, whiche thei left behind vnto vs, might with one conſent, and by this good oportunitie, now at hande, offered, bee augmented, ſo that thei might neuer hereafter fall againe, into the like inconueniences. But whiles thei made ſome ſtaie about the ſetting doune of theſe Articles in writyng, a copie of Lettees was brought vnto them, whiche the Lordes of the Eſtates had written to Don Ihon of Auſtriche, by whiche thei perceiued, that the Lordes of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates were fully determined, to conclude and make an ende, without tariyng for aunſwere from the Prince, and Eſtates of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:11838:166"/>Hollande and Zealande, with Don Ihon of Auſtriche, requiring hym to ſigne them, and promiſing that thei would proclaime them, and receiue Don Ihon of Auſtriche into the Countreis, as Gouernour. Whereupon, when the Prince, and Eſtates of Hollande and Sealande ſawe this alteration, thei greatly mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueiled, conſideryng that the date of the ſaied Letters (which was alſo brought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>o them in poſt) beare the very ſame date as it were, that the Lorde of Wileruall arriued. For, thei were out of all doubt, fully perſwaded, and thought thei ſhould ſo ſinde it, that in a treatie of ſuche importaunce and weight, whereon depended the whole welfare, or ruine, of all the lowe Countreis, thei had greatly ouer ſhotte them ſelues. Neuertheleſſe, ſeeyng that thei thinke and conſtantly beleeue, that it is ſo muche the rather doen, for the riddyng of the Spanyardes and other forrainers out of the Countrie, thei could not but wiſhe, and with all their hartes doe wiſh and praie to God, that the end maie be ſuche, as all good defenders of their Countries hope and looke for. And as for them ſelues, ſithe it were now in vaine to yeelde reaſons againſt thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges concluded vppon and ended, thei promiſe, and doe aſſure the Lordes of the Eſtates, to purſue and defende by all meanes poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the pacification concluded vpon at Gant, liuyng in good hope alſo, the ſame to be the meanyng likewiſe, of the Lordes of the Eſtates, and therefore doe beſeeche them, in all places to ſhewe, that thei for their parte are in very deede, readie to doe the like.</p>
                        <p>And to the ende, that euery man might in truthe ſee, that thei haue none other purpoſe but to ridd awaie the Spanyardes and the reſt of the Forrainers, and ſeeke nothyng els but the procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng of peace, and reſtabliſhing of certaine Priuiledges, Lawes, and Franchiſes of the Countreis: thei are contented to accept, and ſubſcribe, of, and to, the ſaied Articles, if it ſhall pleaſe my Lordes of the Eſtates, firſt to promiſe firmely and irreuocably it, and thereupon paſſe their deede Obligatorie, and the ſame to bee alſo ſubſcribed by the Gouernours, chiefe Officers, and Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelles, of all the Prouinces, that ſeyng the tyme, agreed vppon with Don Ihon of Auſtriche, for the driuyng awaie of the Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yardes, is now expired: to call to a reckonyng vpon ſuche a daie of this Moueth, as the Eſtates ſhall appoint, all ſuche Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yardes as are not yet departed the Countreis there aboutes, and

And about 10. of the Clocke in the night, there iſſued 26. valiaunt Souldiers, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the conduct of Ihon Vorberg, Captaine Cornput his Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunt, who charged the very body of the Watche, whiche laie betweene Gieſt Gate, and Onniger Gate, and there, ſo pretely well cooled the courages, of 24. men of the ſaied Watche, as that 20. of them were leaft dead in the place, and three caried awaie priſoners, and one of them whiche would not goe, was hurt vnto death, and left without the Citie, where he died that night: but he that was in the watch, ſaued himſelf with a light paire of heeles.</p>
            <p>The 2. of the ſaied Moneth in the night, the Enemie caſt vp the Trenche betweene the foreſaied Gates, as if he would haue made there ſome Mount, and therefore, thei likewiſe within be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to make an other Mount, about Gieſt Gate, and then were the Captaines quartered, for the defending of the Rampars. The ſame daie alſo, were twoo deepe ditches made at Gieſt Gate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thei feared, that the Enemie would vndermine the Citie.</p>
            <p>The 3. daie at night, iſſued certaine Souldiers, and ſuddenly fell vpon the Pyoners, certaine Countrie men, and Souldiers, whereof many were ſlaine, and afterwarde thei retiered to the Citie with their butin.</p>
            <p>The 7. Daie thei ſallied out at the Eaſt Gate, and brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie two Souldiers, and a Victualler, Priſoners, leauyng be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde them vpon the waie many hurte men, which would not goe with them. Thei caried alſo awaie with them, in deſpight of the Enemie, fiue Kyne, and a Souldiers wife. The ſame daie in the afternoone, there was the like ſallie, whereat was a liuely ſkir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhe, ſo that by reaſon of the retraict of Captaine Oltholffe his Enſigne bearer, and of Captaine Herman Olthoffe, they were bothe hurt. The Enſigne bearer alſo of Captaine Cornput, ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng vpon the Citie Rampere, was with a Cannon ſhot, ſlaine in the place.</p>
            <p>The 9. daie, the Meſſenger returned with Letters from the
<pb facs="tcp:11838:199"/>Prince and the Eſtates, to the Citie, promiſing to ayde the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and raiſe the Campe of the Enemie. And againe, the night followyng, came in two Citezens, ſaiyng that the ayd was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng on, whiche ſhould helpe the Citie.</p>
            <p>The 11. daie, the Horſemen of the Enemie trouped on from Onnen by Weſtwyke, towardes the Wood, who were brauely hauſled with greate Ordenaunce, from the Toune, to the greate loſſe of their people.</p>
            <p>The 12. of the ſaied Moneth, there was a ſallie and a Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhe made, to the hurte of the Enemie, in whiche, one Willyam Dorth, Captaine Olthoffe his Sergeaunt, was hurt to death, and dyed the next morrow: On which daie in the Sermon while, there came to the Gate, a man at Armes on Horſeback, very wel armed, who was receiued into the Toune: But when the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers ſawe, that he was none of the wiſeſt, or rather a counterfeit, thei thruſt him out of the Gates, after the Sermons were ended, and ſlue him with Harquebouze ſhot, keeping behinde with them his Horſe and Armour.</p>
            <p>The 16. and 17. daie the Enimie battered the Toune, and theſame Euenyng, in token thei had obtained a victorie of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gemans people, the Enemie trailed an Enſigne at his horſe taile, and made Bonefiers rounde about the Citie, as though thei would haue aſſaulted it with fiers.</p>
            <p>The 18.
<note place="margin">The fire ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth holde in Steenwyke.</note> daie, the Enemie ſhotte fier into many places of the Citie, in ſo muche that at one tyme, the Citie was all on a light fier, by reaſon whereof, there were 70. houſes burnt. By this fier, was muche victuall, and other Munitions burnte, to the greate loſſe of the enhabitauntes. Diuerſe houſes in Onniger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreate, through the greate diligence of the Citezens, were ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: and ſo had there been alſo in many other places, if the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers had not garded the Rampares, becauſe the Enemie coſted all alongeſt one ſide of the Citie with Enſigne diſplaied, as though he would haue giuen the aſſault, whiche he might eaſily hatte doen, by reaſon that in many places, the Diches were hard froſen vp.
<note place="margin">The Enemy ſommoneth the Citie.</note> Theſame daie, about the Euenyng, the Enemie ſent twoo Trompetts to ſommon the Citie in his Maieſties name, and to yeeld it ſelf vnto the Prince of Parma, as Captaine Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, and to the Count of Rennenberg as Lieutenaunt, and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:11838:199"/>gouernour of Friſelande, and ſo, thei ſhould depart with bagge and baggage. Whom, Captaine Frauncis Platte, in the name of all the reſte of the Captaines, anſwered: That thei kepte the Citie in the behalfe of his Maieſtie, of Archduke Matthias of Auſtriche, as Captaine Generall, of the Prince of Orenge, his Lieutenaunt, and of the Eſtates: And that thei had none other thyng, for the Count of Rennenberg to commaunde, but Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lettes and pouder: and therefore wiſhed theim quietly departe, without thei liked to be ſaluted with Cannon ſhotte. Theſame night, a meſſenger was diſpatched towardes Campen, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare vnto them, what loſſe thei had receiued by fier.</p>
            <p>The 19. daie, the Enemie, moſte diligently went aboute, to ſhoote fire again into the Citie, but it was to no purpoſe. This night, there came a meſſenger into the Citie: who ſaied, that he had caſt awaie his letters, whiche he had of the Eſtates, becauſe he feared (as he ſaied) thei carried no good newes with theim: and within one houre after, there came in the taile of hym, three other Citezens, agreyng all with one voice, that there was no aide in the whole worlde ready: for, thei ſaied, that the people of the Hegemans was diſcomfited, and the Scluſe and Bloczeell forſaken: wherevpon, the nexte daie followyng, enſued greate trouble and diſſention: For,
<note place="margin">A diuiſion in Steenwyke.</note> many of the Papiſticall Citezens and others, cried out and ſaied, that it was reaſon a Oromme ſhould bee ſent to the Enemie, and the Citie to bee rendred vp. Howbeit, there were certaine Souldiers, and all the reformed citezens, whiche would none of that, who, bothe with faire ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, &amp; alſo with threatnyng wordes, ſaid: that thei would rather kill one an other, then thei would ſo yeld vnto the Enemie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideryng, that thei had no want of victualles: In ſo muche, that many honeſt and conſtant Citezens, did weare that daie, bothe Armour and weapon vnder their cloakes: Some others, gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly accuſed the Prince and the Eſtates, becauſe thei had not holpen certaine Cities, whiche had been beſieged, as, Dopſlach Delffziell, Couerde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Maeſtright, Harlem, and Ziericzea, could largely witneſſe, neuertheleſſe, the reſte ſtoode ſtoutly to their trckle, ſo that in the ende, the trouble and ſedition was ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. And ſone after, there came a Dromme to the gate, bringing letters from captaine Gedeon Pameren, praiyng that he might
<pb facs="tcp:11838:200"/>haue his ſouldiers deliuered for other priſoners; or els for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethes wages, whiche was graunted hym. In the euenyng, the Enemie, very diligently ſought, to ſhoote more Fire into the Toune, but it was to no purpoſe. This night, came in the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and vertuous ſeruaunt of the Countrie, Matthias Kies, bringyng with hym good newes: ſaiyng, that the Eſtates were makyng of the moſte diligent preparation that was poſſible, to aide the Citie,
<note place="margin">Some hope of ayde.</note> as alſo it appeared by the letters of the Eſtates, whiche refreſhed again the hartes of al the white liuered knigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of the Toune: and this night, Herman Henricx, and George Waterwike with one of Hans Vrancquebourg Souldiers, were ſent out of the Citie.</p>
            <p>The 21. of Nouember, there iſſued, aboute the daie breake, out of the Eaſte gate, 70. ſhotte, who laie hidd in a ſecret place, vntill ſome of Weſtwike Campe came that waie: And then, with the aide of the horſemen of the Citie, thei ſette vpon theim, and caried awaie with theim 11. horſes, with a Charrette and Chariot, and a victualler, ſlayng ſuche, as would not goe with them. This victualler, had about him in gold, to the worth of 20. Florins: and when he was examined, he ſaied, that he thought in his opion, that the Enemie meant to plant the greate Orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce in Eaſtwike, and batter the Citie on that ſide, or els caſt fier into it, for the doyng of it the more miſchiefe, but it proued nothyng.</p>
            <p>The 22. the Enemie ſent a Dromme for certaine priſoners whiche thyng the Captaine of the Toune denied hym, for that daie, becauſe he vnderſtoode not of the ſedition, that had been in the Citie, by reaſon of the ill newes, and former fier. The dro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me ſaied, that the Counte by reaſon of this refuſall, would hang all thoſe priſoners whiche were ours, and that thei ſhould heare of other newes ſhortly: but he was anſwered againe, that if thei ſo did, thei would in like maner, deale with the priſoners, whiche thei had of theirs.</p>
            <p>The 23. daie, the Enemie beganne to caſte vp a mightie and ſtrong Trenche from Eaſtwike, aboute the winde Milne hill: and towardes euenyng, he brought thether, three companies of Souldiers: But as the horſemen trouped, on the ſide of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, ſome of them were ſlaine with Muſket ſhotte, and theſame
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:11838:200"/>daie, thei beganne to fill vp the Eaſt gate with yearth, and ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the Rampares, and Vauntmures betwixte the ſaied gate, and Onniger gate. In the Euenyng, the Enemie made a falſe Alarme, and ſhotte at the Citie, as though he would haue giuen the aſſaulte, but nothyng came of it: It is thought, that thei did thus, becauſe thei would not haue the Pioners troubled, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, for that he might the better pitche his Campe in Eaſtwike: and the 24. daie, he alſo ramforced that Trenche, and the watch beyng ſet, brought his people out of the Wood, and made them giue a falſe Alarme about eleuen of the clocke: But becauſe the Touneſmen, ſo tickled them with their ordenaunce, there came nothyng of it.</p>
            <p>The 29. daie, money was cried vp to the double valure, to paie the ſouldiers withall. The nexte morrowe, certaine iſſued out at the Wood gate, towardes the Eaſtbridge, to catche a ſouldier, that was laden with Gambons of Bacon and Butter: who beyng talked with, ſaied: that the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te of Rennenbergue was gone to Groenyng to take vp money, for the appaiſyng of the mutinous ſouldiers. And further told, that our aide was ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together at Winſome, about Zwolle, and that their horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and ſixe Enſignes of footemen, were marched towardes Hauelt, to ſtaie the aide.</p>
            <p>The firſt of December: the weather whiche had of long fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured the Enemie, beganne to alter: and fell to rainyng, blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng, and bluſteryng. And this Euenyng, there iſſued out of the Gieſt gate, about fourtie ſouldiers, to ſurpriſe the Pioners, but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thei found no Pioners there, there iſſued out of the Wood gate, about thirtie ſouldiers mo, to ſound the depth of the Riuer of Ae, and with their ſhot, ſlue certaine of the enemies behinde, as thei ſatte aboute the fier ſide, and gaue many their deathes wounde. Some of ours alſo retourned not ſcotfree, and loſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, twoo of Hans Platte his ſouldiers, bringyng awaie with them notwithſtandyng, ſome ſpoile.</p>
            <p>The third daie, about eight of the Clocke in the Mornyng, thei ſalied out vpon the Enemie,
<note place="margin">The Enemy driuen out of his Trenche with fire.</note> whom thei chaſed out of We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterwike trenches, to the greate loſſe of their people, came back with the ſpoile of the Armour and weapon of fourtie ſouldiers, beſides cloakes and other apparell. This night, was the enemy
<pb facs="tcp:11838:201"/>driuen out of his Trenche, with a balle of wilde fier, whiche the Tounſmen had caſte into the ſaied Trenche.</p>
            <p>The fourth daie, the Enemie forſooke his little Trenche, whiche laie wholy aboute the Citie: and theſame euenyng, thei beganne to ſette open the Onniger gate, whiche had been ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard vp with yearth. The night enſuyng, there iſſued out again about thirtie ſhotte, who hauſled the body of the Watche with a liuely volee of ſhotte: and in the meane while, other thirtie ſette vpon the Trenche, whiche was but ſclenderly manned, ſome of whiche thei fiue. This night alſo, came into the Citie, twoo of our meſſengers, who brought good newes of our aide.</p>
            <p>The ſixte daie, Onniger gate, was ſett ſo wide open as that a 150. Souldiers and Horſes, went out of it, where thei made an hott ſkirmiſhe with the Enemie, who, ſo forſooke his Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as that he was driuen from al the Trenches that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Onniger gate, and the Wood gate, whiche was driuen open with the force of a Mallet, for the ſauyng of our men from the greate Ordenaunce of the Enemie. This night, our menne gaue the Enemie three Alarmes, at the firſt of whiche, he ſhotte of twiſe againſt Onneger Gate, howbeit there was no hurte doen.</p>
            <p>The ſeuenth daie, thei beganne to builde vp a counter ſcarfe before Onniger gate: wherevpon, there came out of the Wood twoo Cornettes of horſemen, and a bande of Almain horſemen: but ſo ſoone as thei were come into the Southe parte of the Campe, the Enemie began to ſette hymſelf in order, as though he would haue giuen the Alarme: and then thei ſent many ſhott to the counter ſcarfes of the Citie, and ſettyng vpon the Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, draue out the Enemie. This night, the Enemie had ſixe Alarmes, ſo luſtely giuen hym, as that he tooke no reſte at all. And our men had a ſigne of fire giuen them, vppon Coldervene Tower, as it was promiſed theim. But after that our aide was once paſſed the Blacke water, the Enemie beganne to make a Bridge of boates ouer the Riuer of Ae, and ſo filled lowe plaine grounde with faggottes and other thinges, that he might come from one quarter of his Campe to the other.</p>
            <p>The nineth daie in the mornyng, certaine Souldiers iſſued out, and tooke awaie twoo fatte Oxen from the Enemie. Then
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:11838:201"/>was there Alarme ſounded in the Campe, wherevpon, the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie beganne to ſhewe his hedde: and had placed a band of Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wike Wood, and therefore, for that daie, were no more ſallies made. The ſouldiers of the Toune likewiſe,
<note place="margin">The tounes men, ſet vp a bande of horſemen.</note> had ſett vp a bande of horſemen, for the daiely makyng of their ſallies, ouer whom, thei appointed Captaine Girard Holten of Geldrelande, a man of great valure, and Lieutenaunt to Conrad Edenrats of Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enwike.</p>
            <p>The tenth daie, a ſallie was made as before, in whiche thei tooke three priſoners, and becauſe one of theim would not goe on, he was ſlaine, and one of the other was deliuered the ſame daie vpon his raunſome. And as our Captaines had deliuered the priſoner vnto the Dro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me, there was a Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>non ſhot came out of the Campe, whiche ſo ſprinkled the dirte aboute their eares, as that bothe the Dromme, and the priſoner, were in greate dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of their liues.</p>
            <p>The eleuenth daie, the horſemen of the Toune, aſſembled theim ſelues in the Market place, and had gotten vp, vppon the Rampares with their Guidon, as if a band of horſemen had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the Toune: Wherevppon, the Enemie beganne to breake doune the bridge towardes Nieſtiecke, but thei were ſoone dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen thence, by certaine ſouldiers whiche iſſued out of the toune who brought with them ſuche inſtrumentes, as thei were won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to vſe, after ſome ſmall ſkirmiſhe. Theſame daie, the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie put twoo Kine into the Medowes liyng on the toune ſide, thinkyng thereby, to entrappe ſome of our menne, becauſe thei laied in ambuſhe many horſemen and others, whiche thyng out people ſuſpectyng, ſaied vnto the Enemie, that the Kine were ouer leane, and therefore willed them to ſende fatter thether.</p>
            <p>The 12. of the ſaied Moneth, the Enemie diſcharged three Cannon ſhot vpon the Toune, for a watche worde: wherevpon, bothe, the Launces, and ſhot, ſhe wed them ſelues abroade in the plaine fieldes, whether alſo were come, from Weſterwyke two Companies of Footemen. And then thei beganne to entrench a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Onnen, that thei might keepe backe our ayde, but it was to no purpoſe. The ſame Euenyng were ſent two Meſſengers to aſke councell about the affaires of the warres, to get ayde, and to ſhew the eſtate of our Citie and the eſtate of the Enemy. The
<pb facs="tcp:11838:202"/>Souldiers who had the conuaiyng of the Meſſengers, fell im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly vpon the Enemie and ſlewe three of the Watche, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng a greate and long Alarum vpon them.</p>
            <p>The 13. daie, thei ſallied out twiſe, to ſee if thei could catche any, but at laſt Gerarde Holt, tooke an Harquebouzer: and after he had taken his Harquebouze from hym, he caried hym awaie Priſoner, who was recouered, by two bandes of Horſemen, and two Enſignes of Footemen, but yet thei caried awaie the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebouze with them.</p>
            <p>This night before Midnight, were ſeene two ſignes of fire, and an other after midnight, accordingly as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Meſſengers were enioyned to doe, the meaning whereof, our Captaines right well knewe.</p>
            <p>The 14. daie, the Enemie ſhe wed hymſelf with foure Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons of Horſemen,
<note place="margin">The Count of Rennen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg, goeth to ſee the Horſemen.</note> who at laſt, put them ſelues in order of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile: At whiche tyme, the Counte of Rennenbergue came the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who wheeling about, went from him, the Enemies diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyng all their Piſtolles, to honour hym withall. Then, the Tounes men, diſcharged a greate peece of Ordenaunce againſt the Troupe, and againſt Weſterwyke Campe alſo, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe againſt Hauſtroyffe quarter, where he lighted from his Horſe. There was alſo another token of fire that night ſeene to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes Scluſe.</p>
            <p>The 15.
<note place="margin">The Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of the toune breake the Iſe.</note> daie, becauſe the water in the Ditches was hard fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen ouer, the Souldiers went out to breake the Iſe, and in the meane while, there went ouer fower of the enemies driuyng an Oxe before them towardes Eaſtwyke. Whiche thyng, when our men whiche were breakyng of the Iſe, ſaw, went, and tooke away the Oxe from the enemie: and although many of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of the Enemie, came thether to recouer it, yet did thei no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng in it, becauſe our Souldiers had in haſte driuen it to the Toune. This night about 11. of the Clocke, the Enemie ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a great Alarme, bothe with Drommes, and Trumpettes. And at that tyme alſo was fire cried at Giethorne, and ſoone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, many houſes were ſeene on a light fire: in ſo muche, that the Enemie diſcharged three Cannons for the watch word, that the Horſemen might get together. There was alſo a greate noyſe, of aboue an hundred Cartes and Horſes heard, whiche came out
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:11838:202"/>of the Countrey of Drenthe: but when the daie appeared, bothe, the cartes and alſo the carters were cleane gone: for thei whiche had ſet Giethorne on fire, came not nere it.
<note place="margin">A forte of of Carted.</note> The next Morrowe in the euenyng, Stuper his companie, had broken the Iſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Onniger Gate, and Gieſt Gate, and ſo euen vnto the Wood Gate. This night likewiſe, was a greate noyſe, bothe of Cartes and Horſes in the Enemies Campe.</p>
            <p>The 17. daie, iſſued out ſeuen Souldiers to entrappe ſome of the Enemies nere vnto the Eaſterne bridge, three of whiche were vpon Fredericke Lutgene his lande, and the other fower in the Banke ditche. But ſo ſoone as two of the Enemies of Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterwyke Campe ſawe, that the aforeſaied three, would needes charge them, thei purpoſed forth with to ſaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues through the lightneſſe of their heeles. Whiche thyng when the other fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer ſawe, thei left their ambuſſhyng, and tooke the one, and the other eſkaped with leapyng ouer the Riuer of Ae. When thei had brought the priſoner to the Towne, he was examined, who ſaied, that our people had been at Giethorne, and taken Ortho of Sauton Droſſat of Harderwike priſoner, ſlaine his ſonne, grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly wounded his guarde corpes, and put his Souldiers to flight. And beſides, that our me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were come to Meppell, with 23. Enſignes of Footemen, whom the Enemie thought to remoue, going thether but with 10. Enſignes of Footemen, &amp; a certaine nomber of Horſemen, but it was all in vaine. And further he ſaid, that the knight of Nieuorte, was in the Countrey of Groenyng with a great nomber of Souldiers. There was alſo a Dromme ſent to the Enemie, to knowe whether he would redeeme his Souldier with a raunſome or no. And he ſaied that he would, howbeit, he threatned for all that to hang him, ſo ſoone as he had hym, if ſo be that thei of the Toune would not doe it before: but thei of the Toune, accordyng to their cuſtome, and former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, would not doe it, and the reaſon whiche moued the enemie to cauſe him to be ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged was this, that he went from the Campe without their leaue and licence. The ſame daie, the twoo Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers whiche brake the Iſe of the Ditches, ſet vpon a Souldier of the enemie, who had giuen them ſome occaſion, hauyng none other weapons about them, but the tooles wherewith thei brake the Iſe, one of whiche, named Ihon Montiew, as he was cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled
<pb facs="tcp:11838:203"/>to the enemie, was ſlaine with an Harquebouze ſhott, and after he was dead, the enemie gaue hym many a ſtappe with his dagger,
<note place="margin">The crueltie of the enemy</note> criyng with a loude voyce: wee are the Souldiers of Suater, and thus will we handle all the reſt of you, ye Horſe ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. This their crueltie, reſtranged the hartes of many from them, and encouraged many, to withſtande them to the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt. This night, about twelue of the Clocke, came into the Toune, our three Meſſengers of the Citie, bringing newes that thei had left at the Blacke Scluſe 36. companies of Souldiers, and at Bergmer Bridge 300. horſe, comming to ayd vs. There was alſo a token of fire, made vpon the Tower, which when the Enemie ſawe, he diſcharged a greate peece of Ordenaunce, but (thankes be to God) did no hurt at all, and the bullet was founde in the Churchyarde.</p>
            <p>The 18. daie being rainie and miſtie, there was a ſallie made, to know whether the Enemie that laie ſo ſtill, was ſtrong or no: and after thei had ſkirmiſhed a while, thei retiered on either ſide, by reaſon of the miſt: But about eight of the Clocke at night the Enemie gaue a falſe Alarme, and ſhot of, twiſe.</p>
            <p>The 19. daie, the Enemie ſhott of thriſe, whiche was, as it was thought, a certaine watch worde: for, three Horſemen came from the Wood, and the Enemie ſounded the Alarme: and there might be ſeene many Souldiers marche without weapon from Weſterwike, towardes the Wood. This night, about midnight came into the Toune, certaine Meſſengers with charge and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Colonell Norris an Engliſhe man, aduertiſing them that the Enemie had been the 18. daie, with 11. Enſignes of Foote men, and ſixe Cornettes of Horſemen at the Blacke Scluſe. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that the Army of the Eſtates, was retired from Meppell, the Enemie thought to haue diſcomfited and ouerthrowen the three Companies whiche were left at the ſaied place: howbeit, thei met there, with ſuche an encounter, as that twoo of their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines were ſlaine in the place, two Enſignes taken, about 500. Souldiers ſlaine, the Armour and weapon of 500. men left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde,
<note place="margin">A diſcomfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Enemie at the Blacke Scluſe.</note> and an Enſigne bearer taken priſoner: and becauſe, that after the entre of theſe Meſſengers, a token of fire was giuen vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Tower, the Enemie ſhott of a greate peece of Orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:11838:203"/>The twentie daie, there was ſo greate an hurly burly in the Campe of the Enemie, as that thei might be heard criyng, euen to the Rampars of the Toune, money, money: but becauſe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of our Captaines went out with ſome of their Souldiers into their emptie trenches, to vnderſtand ſomething more of this hurly burly, ſome of the enemies perceiuyng them, there was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non plentifull dealyng of Harquebouze ſhott, on either ſide, and beſides, the Enemie let flie a Cannon ſhott amongſt the thickeſt. Then beganne ſome of the Captaines of the Toune to make a counterſcarfe before the Wood Gate, which was an hazardous thyng to doe. And ſoone after, the Enemie fell on criyng out and ſaiyng, ha poore ſoules, get you out, and looke for Walter Hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gemans: Then aunſwered the Touneſmen them againe ſaiyng: It were very ſmall honour to vs to ſerue ſuche traitours: but (ꝙ thei) wee will goe to the Blacke Scluſe, and Meppell, and wee doubt not, but to finde there, both Enſignes, Armour, Weapon, and Paye of yours. After midnight, the Enemie once againe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged three Cannon ſhott, and the Horſemen of the Wood ſhocked on, and eftſoones was a noyſe in the Campe, criyng, Arme, Arme.</p>
            <p>The 21. daie, thei made a ſallie, and tooke a Page, who being examined, could ſaie nothing: wherevpon, thei ſhore his head like a Frier, and then draue hym out of the Toune. And about three of the Clocke in the afternoone, the Enemie ſhott of ſeuen Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non ſhott, beſides ſixe balles of wilde fire, one of whiche lighted in the plain before the Toune, and an other vpon Marſhall Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geren his Barne, whiche, through the greate diligence of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tezens was quenched. The ſame daie alſo, the Citezens and the Souldiers, had deuiſed an enterpriſe againſt Eaſtwike: how be it, the Captaines fruſtrated their purpoſe. This night alſo, went fower Meſſengers out of the Toune, whoſe conuaie, cauſed a great Alarme, in bothe the Campes.</p>
            <p>The 22. daie, thei went on, with their ſaid counterſcarfe, and the Enemy payd a priſoners raunſome, who had been a Moneth priſoner, it was thought that thei did it, to the ende that by hym, thei might the better vnderſtande the ſtate of the Toune. This night enſuyng, there came into the Toune, twoo Meſſengers, who brought with them 40. Souldiers, cariyng on their backes
<pb facs="tcp:11838:204"/>700. poundes of Gunpouder in leather bagges, and an Enſigne, whiche the Enemie had loſt at the Blacke Scluſe.</p>
            <p>The 23. daie in the afternoone, ſome of Meppell made a road to Steenwike, and fiered certaine houſes at Ounen. When the Enemie ſawe this he marched with a great companie towardes the place, and the Tounes men ſallied out, and brauely ſkirmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with hym, where many, bothe on the one ſide and the other were ſlaine: and yet but one Tounes man, whoſe name was Francis Platt. Then the Enemie, caried a waie his dead, bothe, on horſbacke, and alſo by wagon, and loſt beſides, a good ſorte of Horſes. The Enſigne that was brought from the Blacke Scluſe, was caried in deſpite, rounde about the Toune vpon the Rampars. This night alſo, certaine Meſſengers whiche were gone out of the Toune, came in again, by reaſon that the Moone ſhoone ſo bright, fearyng thereby, to bee diſcouered. This night likewiſe, the Enemie beganne to entrenche in Iſſeene waie, but the next morrowe, the Tounes men had caſt it quite and cleane doune.</p>
            <p>The 24. daie at night, Captaiue Conrade of Steenwike, Maiſter ziger-ter ſteigh and others, went out of the Toune, whiche thoſe Souldiers had brought in the pouder aforeſaied, meaning to goe to Meppell, to deuiſe and conclude with the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall of the Armie, and the councell for the warres, about ſome enterpriſe and meanes, that might beſt ſerue for their deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce and ayde: but as thei were about the little trench whiche was caſt vp, vppon the waie aforeſaied, and ſhould paſſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Enemie, the Alarme: and therevpon our men retiered, becauſe thei knewe not the nomber whiche came againſt them: And as thei went ouer the foreſaied planke, three Engliſhmen fell into the Riuer of Ae, and ſo were drouned. And foorthwith, the Enemie had the Alarme giuen hym on either ſide, to the end he ſhould not vnderſtande our peoples meanyng and deuiſe.</p>
            <p>The 25. of the ſaied Moneth, Captaine Francis Platt was buried in our Lady Churche, and the 26. certaine Meſſengers
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:11838:204"/>were ſent out, to declare the ſtate of the Toune.</p>
            <p>The 27. daie at night, the Enemie beganne to caſt a trenche before Ouniger Gate, to keepe them backe from fallyng. This night alſo were certaine houſes burnt at Onnen. This daie like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, the Enemie made a paſſage, from Eaſterwike Campe, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Riuer of Ae, towardes the little trenche of Iſueniger Bancke.</p>
            <p>The 28. daie in the mornyng, Onnen houſes, were againe ſeene on fire, and it was thought that the Enemie did it, to the ende that we ſhould haue no ſhelter for our ſauftie. The Enemie alſo, cauſed certaine long peeces of Timber to bee caried awaie: and in the afternoone, ſent a Trompet to the Wood Gate, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monyng the Toune to render it ſelf into the handes of George de Lalayng: who was aunſwered, that thei could not doe it,
<note place="margin">The Enemy ſommoneth the Toune.</note> with out thei ſhould loſe their honor, and breake their othe, whiche thei meant not to doe, ſo long as thei had one droppe of bloud in their bodies. When the Captaines were retourned from the ſaied Trompet, thei fearyng, that ſome trouble, herevpon, might ariſe amongeſt the Citezens, tolde theim, that the Enemie had loſt two Gentlemen, and thinkyng them, to bee taken priſoners by ſome of the Toune, was ſent to craue their deliueraunce, in pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng their raunſome.</p>
            <p>The 29. daie in the mornyng, thei ſallied out at Onniger Gate, but it was to no purpoſe, becauſe there was neuer a man come from the Campe. At night, the Muſketers were placed before the wood Gate, who ſhreudly galled the Horſemen which ſhocked to and fro the Watche.</p>
            <p>The 30. daie, about the daie breake, there came certaine meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers into the Toune, who brought from the Eſtates 1600.

The ſame daie alſo, came one of the Souldiers of the Enemie vnto Onniger Gate, mouyng with vile and ſclaunderous ſpeaches and deedes, the tounes men to anger, who was ſlaine there, for his great paines. This mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng, Letters were brought from the Generall of the Campe, and from Colonell Stayper, by whiche, one Ihon van Beeren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brooke Ihon Staypers Lieutenaunt, was appointed Captaine, in Captaine Francis Platt his place, lately ſlaine, and the ſaied Lieutenauntſhip, was giuen to Michael Haghen of Embricke.</p>

This night alſo, the Tounes men beganne to caſt a Trenche, nere to Onniger Gate, whiche ranne as farre as the enemies trenche, whiche very fitly ſerued the Toune Souldiers for their ſalliyng, and that, greatly greeued the Enemie.</p>

Howbeit, the Lorde GOD who euer defendeth his, ſhewed therein a wonderfull peece of woorke: For, our menne were no ſoner gone out of the Toune, but that the Miſtes brake vp, and that the aire became ſo cleare, as that our menne, might eaſely perceiue and ſee, all the ambuſhes, whiche were lated for them: in ſo muche that the Enemie loſte moe of his menne, then we had loſte the daie before, and ſo for that tyme, wee retourned to the Tonne, without any loſſe at all.</p>
            <p>The 2. daie, the Enemy diſcharged two peeces of Ordnance vpon the Pioners, as thei were labouryng about the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcarfe, &amp; caſting of the trenches.

            <p>The thirteene daie of Ianuary, a bill was made of all the Kine, Horſes, Swine, Corne, and all other kindes of Victual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les: And a ſkirmiſhe alſo was betweene our Giethorniſtes and the Enemie. And at night twoo ſignes of fire was ſeen at Gie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorne: and the night followyng the Enemie had twoo Alar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes giuen. Aboute the daie breake, the Enemie called to our Watche, and aſked theim, if thei had eaten all their Dogges and Cattes: tellyng them further, that thei would before it wer long, come into the Toune, and hang vp Olthoffes Souldiers vpon the Rampares: and beſides, that our lookyng for aide was in vaine, becauſe we were like to haue none: and that we ſhould bee deliuered euen as Delfziill was, where in deede our aide was moſte manifeſtly to be ſeen, whiche woordes thei ſpake, to diſcourage the Souldiers of the Toune.</p>
            <p>The fourteenth of Ianuary, there came out from about the Bulwoorkes, about thirtie horſemen, ſhockyng firſte on towar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des Eaſtwike Trenche, and anon towardes Weſtwike, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what nere the Artillarie of the Enemie, but it was to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, for the Enemie laye quietly in his Trenches.

            <p>The fifteene daie of this monethe, George de Lalyng, ſent by a Dromme, a deſpitefull letter to Captaine Ihon Cornput, and beſides, there were certaine letters written in Frenche by the Prince of Orenge, and ſent to the Duke of Alenſon, whiche were intercepted, and the Commentaries that were made of them. Theſe letters cauſed many mutinous Souldiers to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, becauſe thei might not knowe the contentes of them.</p>
            <p>The ſixteene daie before Dinner, there iſſued out certaine horſemen, and harquebouziers, and brought home with theim a Countrie man, of the lande of Heſſen, who knewe nothyng of the eſtate of the Enemie. About noone, the Enemie came forthe to anger the Iſe breakers: wherevpon certaine Souldiers ſet vpon them in ſkirmiſhe, where thei hurte ſome of the enemies: and emongeſt the reſte, was an ouer hazardous Walon ſlaine, and pitefully dealt withall, in the reuenge of Ihon Montieu of Northdike. In the afternoone, an other ſallie was made, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, where thei got a Page priſoner, who gaue them ſufficient knowledge of the eſtate of the Enemie. This daie alſo, was there a greate controuerſie betweene the Magiſtrate and the Captaines, aboute the Souldiers preſte. And this night came backe the ſixe meſſengers aforeſaied, who brought newes, that vpon Fridaie next, our aide would be at the Wood.</p>
            <p>The eightene, the Campe of Giethorne remoued before the daie breake, and came to the Wood, ſettyng many houſes on fire, where the Roiters, and the Campe of the fower companies were driuen awaie. Then the Touneſmen ſallied out in greate nombers, brauely ſkirmiſhyng on euery ſide: where many on either parte were ſlaine, and taken priſoners. After this the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie marched very ſtrongly towardes the Wood,
<note place="margin">The En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhe men ready to ſet vpon the Toune.</note> meanyng to charge the Engliſhmen, and diſcomfite them: but in the ende he was enforced, for all his iolly cannonyng of about three ſcore bullettes, bothe vpon them of the Toune, and vpon them in the Wood, to retire with greate loſſe. And his loſſe had been farre greater, if the Touneſmen and their aſſiſtauntes, had had any watche woorde betweene theim. Then beganne the weather to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:11838:207"/>breake vp and thawe, and to be very Miſtie, whiche greatly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntaged the Engliſhmen, and thoſe whiche laie in the wood. Who, in the night retired from the wood to Blockzill, giuyng vs notice thereof by the ſignes of fire.</p>
            <p>The nineteene of Ianuary, the Enemie a freſhe ſommoned the Toune by letters, containyng, that all Straungers and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Citezens ſhould bee licenſed, to departe with their bodies and gooddes: but that he would haue the periured ones to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered into his handes, that he might execute the Lawe vppon theim.

He called alſo for the priſoners, and threatened likewiſe to hang our priſoners, ere many daies were at an ende: Howbeeit, Captaine Conrade of Steenwike and others, who were appoincted for that purpoſe, anſwered hym againe by worde of mouthe: that it was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for them, ſo to forget, and breake their othe: becauſe thei had ſworne to the vnited Prouinces, to keepe the Toune, ſo long as thei had any life within theim: and therefore would obſerue the ſame ſtill, lookyng for whatſoeuer it ſhould pleaſe the Lorde God to laie vpon theim. And as concernyng the priſoners, thei anſwered by letters, that thei were contented to keepe the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed lawe of Armes, and therefore deſired to haue in writing a ſpecification from the priſoners, becauſe thei neuer thirſted after their blood: and that if thei hung any of them, thei ſhould be aſſured, that thei would doe the like. Whiche letters were ſent by a priſoner, who, vpon his othe, was ſent from the Enemie, to them of the Toune, and was afterward deliuered with the reſte of the priſoners.</p>
            <p>The 20. daie, there came two meſſengers into the Towne, bryngyng newes, of certaine ſuccour. The ſame daie, the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie offered to obſerue, the lawe at Armes, as was meet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:11838:208"/>and pleaſure. Theſe ſaied Meſſengers declared, that the cauſe why our ſuccour retired from the Wood, was for want of Victuall and Pouder: and did further aſſure them, that the Lord of Nieuorte was marchyng on with 1800. men to ioyne with the Engliſhe men, for our ayde. At that tyme likewiſe, the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie ſent the Tounes men worde, that if thei would forbid their Souldiers the committyng of iniuries, that he would alſo doe the like to his.</p>
            <p>The 21. daie, the Enemie raunſomed, and alſo deliuered, certaine priſoners, for a Monethes wages. He wrote likewiſe letters to the Captaines, wherevpon, might eaſily be coniectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that he ſought by cunnyng and practiſe to ſowe diſſention amongeſt the Companies.</p>
            <p>The 22. daie, the Enemie, as before, deliuered his priſoners by the Dromme. This night, were certaine Meſſengers, a freſh ſent, to declare the neceſſitie of the Toune, who, in the mornyng, made a ſigne with fire, that thei were ſaufly got thether.</p>
            <p>The 24. daie, a peece of Ordenaunce was heard ſhott of, fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer tymes, towardes Sainct Ihons Gate, and many Harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouzes alſo: wherevpon, our men iſſued out of the Toune, but to no purpoſe. And about the euenyng, thei made an other ſallie, in whiche, thei tooke a Victuallers wife of Groenyng, who tolde them all the hiſtorie and ſucceſſe, whiche the Enemie had, againſt the Lorde of Nieuorte, and that he was returned to his Campe with greate loſſe, and merueilous ſhame: whiche thyng fell out happely,

In ſo muche, that our caſe ſtoode in poore eſtate, had not the Lorde God prouide for vs the aſſiſtaunce of the Lorde of Nieuorte and his Friſelanders.</p>
            <p>The 25. of Ianuarie in the mornyng, a ſallie was made, and two Countrey men taken, who confirmed all that, whiche the woman had ſaied. All this daie, was as greate ſhootyng of, of Harquebouzes, heard about Giethorne, as was on the daie and night, immediatly before. And the Enemie alſo, had ſet two hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes on fire about the hye water Milles. He was alſo ſeene retie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng from the Wood, with his baggage, and this night was heard a greate noyſe of Waggons, and in the mornyng, were a
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:11838:208"/>greate nomber of the Royters Waggons ſeen about the great Ordenaunce.</p>
            <p>The 26. daie, was a ſallie made, but all in vaine, becauſe that the Royters of the Enemie, were ouer haſtie in the chargyng of them. And about the euenyng, were ſeen a companie of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, marchyng towardes Giethorne, and at night were ſeene, ſignes of fire. There were likewiſe at ſondrie tymes heard, both of Cannon and Harquebouze ſhott, aſwell at Blockzill, as alſo at Sainct Ihons Campe.</p>
            <p>The 27. daie, were ſallies made both euening and morning, wherein, a Page was taken, who at large declared, how the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie had been euill dealt withall at Sainet Ihons Campe: and that his Souldiers mutined for their wages, yea, ſome of them would not ſticke to ſaie that thei would teare in ſunder their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes. And at night, was a greate fire ſeen at Giethorne.</p>
            <p>The 28. daie, the Touneſmen ſent a Dromme, for the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerie of certaine priſoners, but it was to no purpoſe: for the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie had other matters to doe. This daie, were fower ſallies made, whereof, three were in vaine: but in the fourth, a Muſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier was taken: who ſaied, that the Souldiers helde a councell for their wages, whiche was promiſed them within fower daies, or els be brought into a better corner. There were a great many of Souldiers ſeene marchyng to and fro, laden with their bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage. This night, two Meſſengers came in, and three went out, from whom, the ſignes of fire were ſeen: The newes were good whiche thei brought from Sainct Ihons Campe: and beſides, that the good Knight of Nieuort, came with three hundred Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, laden with Victualles.</p>
            <p>The 29. daie, certaine priſoners were deliuered vpon a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethes wages, and ſome without raunſome, but ſpoyled of all their apparell: The night enſuyng, came out two Meſſengers: and the laſt daie of this Moneth, the Enemie beganne to caſt his Trenche on the North Common: and then was there two ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies made, the one, at the Wood gate, and the other, at Ouniger gate: where, one of the enemies was ſlaine, and an other taken priſoner. This night, retourned the twoo laſt Meſſengers, with the Lorde of Merodes Lieutenaunt, Gouernour of Friſelande, named Adrian Mennickes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:11838:209"/>The firſt of February, the Enemy ſhewed hym ſelf with ten companies of Souldiers in Weſtwike, and with one Enſigne in Eaſtwike: where, he cauſed the place to be changed, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed alſo certaine peeces of Artillary to bee brought on the other ſide: he brake likewiſe the Cannon Stockes, and placed them in the plaine fallowe fieldes about Weſtwike, keeping the depth of Ae altogether on hye. This night alſo went out two Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, but the Enemie chaſed them in again with heaue and hoe.</p>
            <p>The ſeconde of this Moneth, to witt the night followyng, the ſaied Lorde of Merodes Lieutenaunt, retourned towardes Old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merct aſſuryng vs, that we ſhould eftſoone, ſee our ayde.</p>
            <p>The third daie, the Enemie beganne an other Trenche, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioynyng to the other in North Common. This daie thei viſited euery houſe, and tooke an Inuentorie of all the Victualles: and thei, whiche ſaied thei had no Victualles, the Victualles whiche thei had, were taken from them, and giuen to the Souldiers. This daie, came fliyng into the Market place three Partriges, whiche the Souldiers tooke and eate: whiche was a notable to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſent from God, betokenyng the tyme of the deliueraunce of the Citie: for within three weekes after we were deliuered, euen as Captaine Cornput had interpreted it.</p>
            <p>The fourth daie, the ayde came, accordyng to the ſaid Adrian Mennickes promiſe, from Oldmerct, to the Wood, and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie was driuen awaie by our Horſemen: And after that, the whole force of our Armie came together. Then the Enemie ſhot of, twiſe, at the Toune. And when he had ſo doen, he planted his Ordenaunce vpon the Trenche in North Common. He ſhot of alſo, ten tymes at our ayde, and yet did no hurte: but our Orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce paied them a little otherwiſe, to the no ſmall loſſe of his people. This daie, was begunne a Rampart, at Northe newe gate, by whiche our ayde meant to victuall vs: for, thei encam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped at the foote of Hiddyngberg, on Steenwike Toune ſide.</p>
            <p>The fift daie, beyng Sondaie, a ſallie was made, and in the ſkirmiſhe, yong Conrade, the ſonne of Captaine Conrade, was ſlaine with an Harquebouze ſhott. And on the other ſide, thei in the Wood, had a braue ſkirmiſhe with the Enemie: then the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie, couragioufly got vp againſt our men, vnto the toppe of Hiddyngberg, but he was luſtely receiued, and beaten backe to

            <p>The ſixte daie, the Enemie was driuen with all his forces, to keepe a continuall Warde: becauſe our people oftentymes ſkirmiſhed with them.</p>
            <p>The ſeuenth daie, our Souldiers tooke a priſoner, who tolde vs that Captaine Snater, was ſlaine the Sondaie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as he was leadyng his menne againſt our Succours. But at this ſallie, it was twentie to one, that the Enemie had not gotte Onniger gate, but he was luſtely, and courageouſly reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted and repulſed. This daie, the Magiſtrate and Captaines,
<note place="margin">Thei of Steenwike make a newe viewe for victualles.</note> made a newe vewe for Victualles, as aforeſaied: and the ſame date, was greater ſtoare of Victualles confiſked in poore men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes houſes, then in riche, and all becauſe thei were hidden. This night retourned into the Citie, fower Citezens, who brought good newes of certaine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>The nineth daie, our menne and the Enemie coupled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a braue ſkirmiſhe, who loſte many horſes.</p>
            <p>The eleuenth daie of this monethe, was an other ſkirmiſhe made, ſo that our menne receiued three companies of Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. And the nexte morrowe in an Alarme, ſet fire on the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non ſtockes whiche were on the Mill hill and Common.</p>
            <p>The thirteene daie, the Enemie caſte vp an other Trenche in the ſaied North Common, keepyng Steendicque Trenche: And although that this Trenche was hurtfull, bothe to vs, and ours, yet was there nothyng ſaied, nor doen againſt it: So that the night enſuyng, the Enemie beganne to caſte vp an other Trenche in Yſueene waie, holden all in, with the Riuer of Ae, whiche greatly hindred vs: becauſe that the meſſengers, whiche were gone out of the Toune, were enforced to retourne backe.</p>
            <p>The fourteene daie, the Touneſmen on the daie tyme, had giuen vpon the Tower a ſigne of fire, whiche, thei of the Wood might well ſee, whereby thei vnderſtoode, that Victualles grewe ſkant in the Toune. And beſides for want of Wood, thei were faine to pull doune their houſes to make theim fires.
<pb facs="tcp:11838:210"/>The Touneſmen alſo ſallied out vpon the hindermoſt Trench, whiche was caſte vp in Yſueene waie, but it was to no purpoſe: For thei were repulſed by the other Trenches, becauſe that thei whiche laye in the Wood, would not once helpe them: So that thei were driuen to retire, without bryngyng to paſſe their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and deuiſe.</p>
            <p>The fifteene daie, fower Citezens entred the Toune with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtaie, whiche was a woonder: becauſe the Enemie had ſette a watche rounde aboute the Toune, not aboue a ſtones caſt one from an other. This daie a ſigne with fire was giuen, that the Touneſmen, were readie with their Bridges, to paſſe the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of Ae, accordyng to the Generall of the Armies commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement. The Touneſmen alſo caſte vp certaine Trenches in the Garden diches, on the Northe ſide of the Toune, out of whiche, the Souldiers of the Toune, might ſkirmiſhe with the Enemie: In the meane while, the Bridges were with all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpeede, laied ouer the Riuer of Ae, to the ende, that our aide ſhould not haue any occaſion to ſtaie: and in the makyng of this Bridge, there fell out a meruailous ſtraunge caſe: For, whiles the Citezens, aboute nine of the clocke at night, were buſied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute this Bridge, the Enemie in the nexte Trenches, tainted fower of them, with the ſhot of one Harqucbouze, one of whiche was Captaine Conrade, and yet not one of them once hurte.</p>
            <p>The ſixteene date, the Enemie made a Trenche of Wago<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s againſt our Garden Trenches: and the nexte morrowe, a ſallie was made out of Onniger gate, wherin was taken a Souldier and a woman, whiche woman was examined: and forthwith a Dromme was ſent towardes the Enemie, to knowe whether he would deliuer the priſoner or no, whiche he vtterly refuſed. The night following, the Enemie had a notable Marme giuen hym, as if our aide would haue marched vppon hym, but all in vaine, becauſe the Enemie, with all diligence muſtred hym ſelf with all his forces, vpon Northe Common.</p>
            <p>The nineteene daie,
<note place="margin">The Enemy chargeth them in the Wood.</note> aboute the daie breake, the Enemie ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med hym ſelf with all his forces, to charge them in the Wood: but he was ſo luſtely repulſed, as that he was driuen to make his retraict.</p>
            <p>The twentie daie, aboute 200. perſones came to the Toune

This daie, euen at broade noone daie, came into the Toune, fower Citezens and three ſouldiers, who in deſpite of the Enemie, came betweene the Warde, and the Trenches: and although the Enemie commyng out of his trenches, purſued them, yet was there not one of them once tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, nor hurte, whiche ſo encouraged our aide, that thei purpoſed the next daie in the mornyng to reuictuall the Toune.</p>

Loaues, and 150. Cheeſes. The night enſuyng, thei of the Wood, beganne to caſt a newe Trenche, ſome what nexer the Toune. And in the daie the Enemie, with all his forces, preſſed nere to Steendicque Common, but it was not knowne for what cauſe. He very buſily trauciled alſo, to bring his Artillarie behinde Eaſterwike, but it was to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. This daie in the euenyng, came a fliyng Poſt to the Toune with a letter: And the night followyng, the Enemie made a forte of Wagons, at the paſſage, where our men caried ouer the bread and Cheeſe.</p>
            <p>The 22. daie, the weather beganne to thaw, and the Tounes men beganne to caſt vp a newe Trench, within the new Bridge, without North newe gate. About noone, a ſkirmiſhe beganne to be coupled betweene the Roiters of the Wood, and the Roi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Enemie. In ſo muche, that nine of our men iſſued out of their Trenches, and came to North Common, chaſing out of the one of them, the better parte of their Launces: whiche cauſed the Enemie crye Arme, Arme, throughout all his Campe: ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demly ruſhyng with all his forces, vpon the Common: how be it, thei in the Wood, would at no hande retire, although thei were but a fewe Roiters, and an handfull of ſmall ſhott, but moſt cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouſly made hedde vpon the Enemie, drawyng towardes the Toune waie, wherevpon, the Souldiers of the Tnune in ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And although the Enemie, by reaſon of the multitude of his Royters, wonne a paſſage, yet what with thoſe of the Toune behinde, and thoſe of the Wood before, thei were gallantly hanſled with Harquebouze ſhott: and in the ende ſo handled, as that his Souldiers ſquared ſomewhat out of order, in ſo muche that it ſeemed, rather a battle, then a ſkirmiſhe: for, otherwiſe, could not the Roiters bryng their ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to the fight: And therefore, many valiaunt Officers, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of Horſemen, and others of name, were there, ſlaine: In ſo muche, that thei were driuen by reaſon of the raine, to retier in order of battle: This daie alſo, the Cannon on either ſide, plaied her parte luſtely: and the forte of Wagons, whiche the Enemie had made the night before, was broken in peeces, and caried to the Toune. About foure houres, after the Enemie was got to reſt,
<note place="margin">The Towne againe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uictualled.</note> thei of the Wood had reuictualled the Toune, with a pretie ſprinklyng of ſome 75.

Now, the Enemie would by no meanes trouble them, by reaſon that the Touneſmen, had aſſailed the very nereſt Trenche of that paſſage: in whiche were two Enſignes, of ſuche noble courage, as that thei wonne the Trenche, tooke the Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larie, ſlewe 17.

            <p>The 23.
<note place="margin">The ſiege raiſed from before Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enwike.</note> of February, whiche was the daie of the deliuerance of the Toune, aboute the breake of the daie, three Engiſhe men came out of the Wood, and paſſed betweene the Trenches: but when thei perceiued, that there was neither watche nor warde within them, thei came to the Toune, and tolde them of it: then iſſued out of the Toune many men, and lookyng into the Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, founde neuer a man, but the ſeuenteene dead men whiche laie there, and three dead Roiters before the Trenche. Within a while after, the Enemie ſet fire on his Campe, and hauing before
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:11838:211"/>daie, ſent his Artillarie with his footemen before: his horſemen ſtoode in order of battle vntill the afternoone, in the plaine fallow fieldes of Onnen, vntill ſuche tyme as the Engliſhe Colonell, generall of the Campe, came with his Colonelles, Captaines, and Officers, and a fewe horſemen, to paſſe by Steenwike, in the tayle of the Enemie, who as yet brauely muſtered and ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed hym ſelf.

            <p>The 24. of February, the Armie of the Eſtates, departed from the Wood, and marched towardes Oldemerct, to expulſe the Garniſons, whiche the Enemie had thruſt in into Ruynder, Lemmer, Sloten, and many other places moe, whiche after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward was performed. In ſo muche that all theſe places were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine reſtored into the handes of the Eſtates, and vnited Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces.
